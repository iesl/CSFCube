TITLE: Sentiment analysis is not solved! Assessing and probing sentiment classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Neural methods for SA have led to quantitative improvements over previous approaches, but these advances are not always accompanied with a thorough analysis of the qualitative differences.
background_label: Therefore, it is not clear what outstanding conceptual challenges for sentiment analysis remain.
objective_label: In this work, we attempt to discover what challenges still prove a problem for sentiment classifiers for English and to provide a challenging dataset.
method_label: We collect the subset of sentences that an (oracle) ensemble of state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers misclassify and then annotate them for 18 linguistic and paralinguistic phenomena, such as negation, sarcasm, modality, etc.
other_label: The dataset is available at https://github.com/ltgoslo/assessing_and_probing_sentiment.
result_label: Finally, we provide a case study that demonstrates the usefulness of the dataset to probe the performance of a given sentiment classifier with respect to linguistic phenomena.

TITLE: Assessing State-of-the-Art Sentiment Models on State-of-the-Art Sentiment Datasets
ABSTRACT: background_label: There has been a good amount of progress in sentiment analysis over the past 10 years, including the proposal of new methods and the creation of benchmark datasets.
background_label: In some papers, however, there is a tendency to compare models only on one or two datasets, either because of time restraints or because the model is tailored to a specific task.
background_label: Accordingly, it is hard to understand how well a certain model generalizes across different tasks and datasets.
objective_label: In this paper, we contribute to this situation by comparing several models on six different benchmarks, which belong to different domains and additionally have different levels of granularity (binary, 3-class, 4-class and 5-class).
method_label: We show that Bi-LSTMs perform well across datasets and that both LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs are particularly good at fine-grained sentiment tasks (i. e., with more than two classes).
method_label: Incorporating sentiment information into word embeddings during training gives good results for datasets that are lexically similar to the training data.
result_label: With our experiments, we contribute to a better understanding of the performance of different model architectures on different data sets.
result_label: Consequently, we detect novel state-of-the-art results on the SenTube datasets.

TITLE: Representing and Resolving Negation for Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Proper treatment of negation is an important characteristic of methods for sentiment analysis.
background_label: However, while there is a growing body of research on the automatic resolution of negation, it is not yet clear as to how negation is best represented for different applications.
method_label: To begin to address this issue, we review representation alternatives and present a state-of-the-art system for negation resolution that is interoperable across these schemes.
result_label: By employing different configurations of this system as a component in a test bed for lexically-based sentiment classification, we demonstrate that the choice of representation can have a significant impact on downstream processing.

TITLE: Challenges in Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: A vast majority of the work in Sentiment Analysis has been on developing more accurate sentiment classifiers, usually involving supervised machine learning algorithms and a battery of features.
background_label: Surveys by Pang and Lee (Found Trends Inf Retr 2(12):1135, 2008), Liu and Zhang (A survey of opinion mining and sentiment analysis.
background_label: In: Aggarwal CC, Zhai C (eds) In: Mining text data.
method_label: Springer, New York, pp 415463, 2012), and Mohammad (Mohammad Sentiment analysis: detecting valence, emotions, and other effectual states from text.
method_label: In: Meiselman H (ed) Emotion measurement.
method_label: Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2016b) give summaries of the many automatic classifiers, features, and datasets used to detect sentiment.
method_label: In this chapter, we flesh out some of the challenges that still remain, questions that have not been explored sufficiently, and new issues emerging from taking on new sentiment analysis problems.
method_label: We also discuss proposals to deal with these challenges.
objective_label: The goal of this chapter is to equip researchers and practitioners with pointers to the latest developments in sentiment analysis and encourage more work in the diverse landscape of problems, especially those areas that are relatively less explored.

TITLE: Challenges in Discriminating Profanity from Hate Speech
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this study we approach the problem of distinguishing general profanity from hate speech in social media, something which has not been widely considered.
method_label: Using a new dataset annotated specifically for this task, we employ supervised classification along with a set of features that includes n-grams, skip-grams and clustering-based word representations.
method_label: We apply approaches based on single classifiers as well as more advanced ensemble classifiers and stacked generalization, achieving the best result of 80% accuracy for this 3-class classification task.
result_label: Analysis of the results reveals that discriminating hate speech and profanity is not a simple task, which may require features that capture a deeper understanding of the text not always possible with surface n-grams.
result_label: The variability of gold labels in the annotated data, due to differences in the subjective adjudications of the annotators, is also an issue.
result_label: Other directions for future work are discussed.

TITLE: Large Scale Sentiment Learning with Limited Labels
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis is an important task in order to gain insights over the huge amounts of opinions that are generated in the social media on a daily basis.
background_label: Although there is a lot of work on sentiment analysis, there are no many datasets available which one can use for developing new methods and for evaluation.
background_label: To the best of our knowledge, the largest dataset for sentiment analysis is TSentiment [8], a 1.6 millions machine-annotated tweets dataset covering a period of about 3 months in 2009.
background_label: This dataset however is too short and therefore insufficient to study heterogeneous, fast evolving streams.
method_label: Therefore, we annotated the Twitter dataset of 2015 (228 million tweets without retweets and 275 million with retweets) and we make it publicly available for research.
method_label: For the annotation we leverage the power of unlabeled data, together with labeled data using semi-supervised learning and in particular, Self-Learning and Co-Training.
objective_label: Our main contribution is the provision of the TSentiment15 dataset together with insights from the analysis, which includes a batch and a stream-processing of the data.
result_label: In the former, all labeled and unlabeled data are available to the algorithms from the beginning, whereas in the later, they are revealed gradually based on their arrival time in the stream.

TITLE: Biographies, Bollywood, Boom-boxes and Blenders: Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractAutomatic sentiment classification has been extensively studied and applied in recent years.
background_label: However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is impractical.
objective_label: We investigate domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on online reviews for different types of products.
method_label: First, we extend to sentiment classification the recently-proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm, reducing the relative error due to adaptation between domains by an average of 30% over the original SCL algorithm and 46% over a supervised baseline.
method_label: Second, we identify a measure of domain similarity that correlates well with the potential for adaptation of a classifier from one domain to another.
result_label: This measure could for instance be used to select a small set of domains to annotate whose trained classifiers would transfer well to many other domains.

TITLE: Determining negation scope and strength in sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: A key element for decision makers to track is their stakeholders' sentiment.
background_label: Recent developments show a tendency of including various aspects other than word frequencies in automated sentiment analysis approaches.
background_label: One of these aspects is negation, which can be accounted for in various ways.
method_label: We compare several approaches to accounting for negation in sentiment analysis, differing in their methods of determining the scope of influence of a negation keyword.
method_label: On a set of English movie review sentences, the best approach is to consider two words, following a negation keyword, to be negated by that keyword.
method_label: This method yields a significant increase in overall sentiment classification accuracy and macro-level F1 of 5.5% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to not accounting for negation.
result_label: Additionally optimizing sentiment modification of negated words to a value of −1.27 rather than −1 yields a significant 7.1% increase in accuracy and a significant 8.0% increase in macro-level F1.

TITLE: Targeted Sentiment Analysis: A Data-Driven Categorization
ABSTRACT: background_label: Targeted sentiment analysis (TSA), also known as aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aims at detecting fine-grained sentiment polarity towards targets in a given opinion document.
background_label: Due to the lack of labeled datasets and effective technology, TSA had been intractable for many years.
background_label: The newly released datasets and the rapid development of deep learning technologies are key enablers for the recent significant progress made in this area.
background_label: However, the TSA tasks have been defined in various ways with different understandings towards basic concepts like `target' and `aspect'.
method_label: In this paper, we categorize the different tasks and highlight the differences in the available datasets and their specific tasks.
method_label: We then further discuss the challenges related to data collection and data annotation which are overlooked in many previous studies.

TITLE: Examining Gender and Race Bias in Two Hundred Sentiment Analysis Systems
ABSTRACT: background_label: Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases.
background_label: Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems.
background_label: Further, there is no benchmark dataset for examining inappropriate biases in systems.
method_label: Here for the first time, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders.
method_label: We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 'Affect in Tweets'.
result_label: We find that several of the systems show statistically significant bias; that is, they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment intensity predictions for one race or one gender.
result_label: We make the EEC freely available.

TITLE: MultiBooked: A Corpus of Basque and Catalan Hotel Reviews Annotated for Aspect-level Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: While sentiment analysis has become an established field in the NLP community, research into languages other than English has been hindered by the lack of resources.
background_label: Although much research in multi-lingual and cross-lingual sentiment analysis has focused on unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches, these still require a large number of resources and do not reach the performance of supervised approaches.
method_label: With this in mind, we introduce two datasets for supervised aspect-level sentiment analysis in Basque and Catalan, both of which are under-resourced languages.
method_label: We provide high-quality annotations and benchmarks with the hope that they will be useful to the growing community of researchers working on these languages.

TITLE: Linguistically Regularized LSTMs for Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment understanding has been a long-term goal of AI in the past decades.
background_label: This paper deals with sentence-level sentiment classification.
background_label: Though a variety of neural network models have been proposed very recently, however, previous models either depend on expensive phrase-level annotation, whose performance drops substantially when trained with only sentence-level annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words), thus not being able to produce linguistically coherent representations.
method_label: In this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to generating linguistically coherent representations by employing regularizers that model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words.
result_label: Results show that our models are effective to capture the sentiment shifting effect of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, while still obtain competitive results without sacrificing the models' simplicity.

TITLE: Detecting Turnarounds in Sentiment Analysis: Thwarting
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in sentiment analysis, the former because of the lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not.
objective_label: We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain.
method_label: An ontology of the camera domain is created.
method_label: Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level.
method_label: This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge.
method_label: A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline.
method_label: We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system.
result_label: Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance.
result_label: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at least provide a baseline system to compare against.

TITLE: Improving Sentiment Analysis with Multi-task Learning of Negation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis is directly affected by compositional phenomena in language that act on the prior polarity of the words and phrases found in the text.
background_label: Negation is the most prevalent of these phenomena and in order to correctly predict sentiment, a classifier must be able to identify negation and disentangle the effect that its scope has on the final polarity of a text.
objective_label: This paper proposes a multi-task approach to explicitly incorporate information about negation in sentiment analysis, which we show outperforms learning negation implicitly in a data-driven manner.
method_label: We describe our approach, a cascading neural architecture with selective sharing of LSTM layers, and show that explicitly training the model with negation as an auxiliary task helps improve the main task of sentiment analysis.
result_label: The effect is demonstrated across several different standard English-language data sets for both tasks and we analyze several aspects of our system related to its performance, varying types and amounts of input data and different multi-task setups.

TITLE: Tweet Sentiment Analysis by Incorporating Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding and Weighted Text Features
ABSTRACT: background_label: Previous studies have used many manually identified features and word embeddings for tweet sentiment classification.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a new approach, which incorporates sentiment-specific word embeddings (SSWE) and a weighted text feature model (WTFM).
method_label: WTFM produces features based on text negation, tf.idf weighting scheme, and a Rocchio text classification method.
method_label: Compared to other tweet sentiment feature generation approaches, WTFM is easy to build, simple, yet effective.
result_label: Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the two state-of-the-art tweet sentiment classification methods, SSWE and National Research Council Canada's (NRC) model.

TITLE: Evaluating Distant Supervision for Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis on Arabic Twitter Feeds
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSupervised machine learning methods for automatic subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) are problematic when applied to social media, such as Twitter, since they do not generalise well to unseen topics.
objective_label: A possible remedy of this problem is to apply distant supervision (DS) approaches, which learn from large amounts of automatically annotated data.
method_label: This research empirically evaluates the performance of DS approaches for SSA on Arabic Twitter feeds.
result_label: Results for emoticon-and lexiconbased DS show a significant performance gain over a fully supervised baseline, especially for detecting subjectivity, where we achieve 95.19% accuracy, which is a 48.47% absolute improvement over previous fully supervised results.

TITLE: A Sentiment Treebank and Morphologically Enriched Recursive Deep Models for Effective Sentiment Analysis in Arabic
ABSTRACT: background_label: Accurate sentiment analysis models encode the sentiment of words and their combinations to predict the overall sentiment of a sentence.
background_label: This task becomes challenging when applied to morphologically rich languages (MRL).
objective_label: In this article, we evaluate the use of deep learning advances, namely the Recursive Neural Tensor Networks (RNTN), for sentiment analysis in Arabic as a case study of MRLs.
objective_label: While Arabic may not be considered the only representative of all MRLs, the challenges faced and proposed solutions in Arabic are common to many other MRLs.
method_label: We identify, illustrate, and address MRL-related challenges and show how RNTN is affected by the morphological richness and orthographic ambiguity of the Arabic language.
method_label: To address the challenges with sentiment extraction from text in MRL, we propose to explore different orthographic features as well as different morphological features at multiple levels of abstraction ranging from raw words to roots.
method_label: A key requirement for RNTN is the availability of a sentiment treebank; a collection of syntactic parse trees annotated for sentiment at all levels of constituency and that currently only exists in English.
method_label: Therefore, our contribution also includes the creation of the first Arabic Sentiment Treebank (ArSenTB) that is morphologically and orthographically enriched.
result_label: Experimental results show that, compared to the basic RNTN proposed for English, our solution achieves significant improvements up to 8% absolute at the phrase level and 10.8% absolute at the sentence level, measured by average F1 score.
method_label: It also outperforms well-known classifiers including Support Vector Machines, Recursive Auto Encoders, and Long Short-Term Memory by 7.6%, 3.2%, and 1.6% absolute respectively, all models being trained with similar morphological considerations.

TITLE: Tweet Sentiment: From Classification to Quantification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment classification has become a ubiquitous enabling technology in the Twittersphere, since classifying tweets according to the sentiment they convey towards a given entity (be it a product, a person, a political party, or a policy) has many applications in political science, social science, market research, and many others.
background_label: In this paper we contend that most previous studies dealing with tweet sentiment classification (TSC) use a suboptimal approach.
other_label: The reason is that the final goal of most such studies is not estimating the class label (e.g., Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of individual tweets, but estimating the relative frequency (a.k.a.
objective_label: "prevalence") of the different classes in the dataset.
method_label: The latter task is called quantification, and recent research has convincingly shown that it should be tackled as a task of its own, using learning algorithms and evaluation measures different from those used for classification.
result_label: In this paper we show, on a multiplicity of TSC datasets, that using a quantification-specific algorithm produces substantially better class frequency estimates than a state-of-the-art classification-oriented algorithm routinely used in TSC.
result_label: We thus argue that researchers interested in tweet sentiment prevalence should switch to quantification-specific (instead of classification-specific) learning algorithms and evaluation measures.

TITLE: Collaborative Multi-domain Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment classification is a hot research topic in both industrial and academic fields.
background_label: The mainstream sentiment classification methods are based on machine learning and treat sentiment classification as a text classification problem.
background_label: However, sentiment classification is widely recognized as a highly domain-dependent task.
background_label: The sentiment classifier trained in one domain may not perform well in another domain.
background_label: A simple solution to this problem is training a domain-specific sentiment classifier for each domain.
method_label: However, it is difficult to label enough data for every domain since they are in a large quantity.
method_label: In addition, this method omits the sentiment information in other domains.
method_label: In this paper, we propose to train sentiment classifiers for multiple domains in a collaborative way based on multi-task learning.
background_label: Specifically, we decompose the sentiment classifier in each domain into two components, a general one and a domain-specific one.
background_label: The general sentiment classifier can capture the global sentiment information and is trained across various domains to obtain better generalization ability.
method_label: The domain-specific sentiment classifier is trained using the labeled data in one domain to capture the domain-specific sentiment information.
method_label: In addition, we explore two kinds of relations between domains, one based on textual content and the other one based on sentiment word distribution.
method_label: We build a domain similarity graph using domain relations and encode it into our approach as regularization over the domain-specific sentiment classifiers.
method_label: Besides, we incorporate the sentiment knowledge extracted from sentiment lexicons to help train the general sentiment classifier more accurately.
method_label: Moreover, we introduce an accelerated optimization algorithm to train the sentiment classifiers efficiently.
result_label: Experimental results on two benchmark sentiment datasets show that our method can outperform baseline methods significantly and consistently.

TITLE: Sentiment Embeddings with Applications to Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose learning sentiment-specific word embeddings dubbed sentiment embeddings in this paper.
background_label: Existing word embedding learning algorithms typically only use the contexts of words but ignore the sentiment of texts.
background_label: It is problematic for sentiment analysis because the words with similar contexts but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, are mapped to neighboring word vectors.
objective_label: We address this issue by encoding sentiment information of texts (e.g., sentences and words) together with contexts of words in sentiment embeddings.
method_label: By combining context and sentiment level evidences, the nearest neighbors in sentiment embedding space are semantically similar and it favors words with the same sentiment polarity.
method_label: In order to learn sentiment embeddings effectively, we develop a number of neural networks with tailoring loss functions, and collect massive texts automatically with sentiment signals like emoticons as the training data.
method_label: Sentiment embeddings can be naturally used as word features for a variety of sentiment analysis tasks without feature engineering.
method_label: We apply sentiment embeddings to word-level sentiment analysis, sentence level sentiment classification, and building sentiment lexicons.
result_label: Experimental results show that sentiment embeddings consistently outperform context-based embeddings on several benchmark datasets of these tasks.
result_label: This work provides insights on the design of neural networks for learning task-specific word embeddings in other natural language processing tasks.

TITLE: SlangSD: Building and Using a Sentiment Dictionary of Slang Words for Short-Text Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment in social media is increasingly considered as an important resource for customer segmentation, market understanding, and tackling other socio-economic issues.
background_label: However, sentiment in social media is difficult to measure since user-generated content is usually short and informal.
background_label: Although many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying slang sentiment words remains untackled.
background_label: One of the reasons is that slang sentiment words are not available in existing dictionaries or sentiment lexicons.
method_label: To this end, we propose to build the first sentiment dictionary of slang words to aid sentiment analysis of social media content.
method_label: It is laborious and time-consuming to collect and label the sentiment polarity of a comprehensive list of slang words.
method_label: We present an approach to leverage web resources to construct an extensive Slang Sentiment word Dictionary (SlangSD) that is easy to maintain and extend.
method_label: SlangSD is publicly available for research purposes.
result_label: We empirically show the advantages of using SlangSD, the newly-built slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with an existing sentiment system.

TITLE: Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied to Unsupervised Classification of Reviews
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down).
background_label: The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs.
method_label: A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g.,"subtle nuances") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g.,"very cavalier").
method_label: In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word"excellent"minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word"poor".
method_label: A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive.
result_label: The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations).
result_label: The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.

TITLE: The Effect of Negators, Modals, and Degree Adverbs on Sentiment Composition
ABSTRACT: background_label: Negators, modals, and degree adverbs can significantly affect the sentiment of the words they modify.
background_label: Often, their impact is modeled with simple heuristics; although, recent work has shown that such heuristics do not capture the true sentiment of multi-word phrases.
method_label: We created a dataset of phrases that include various negators, modals, and degree adverbs, as well as their combinations.
method_label: Both the phrases and their constituent content words were annotated with real-valued scores of sentiment association.
method_label: Using phrasal terms in the created dataset, we analyze the impact of individual modifiers and the average effect of the groups of modifiers on overall sentiment.
result_label: We find that the effect of modifiers varies substantially among the members of the same group.
result_label: Furthermore, each individual modifier can affect sentiment words in different ways.
result_label: Therefore, solutions based on statistical learning seem more promising than fixed hand-crafted rules on the task of automatic sentiment prediction.

TITLE: Improving Sentiment Analysis in an Online Cancer Survivor Community Using Dynamic Sentiment Lexicon
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online Health Communities is a major source for patients and their family members in the process of gathering information and seeking social support.
background_label: The American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network has many users and presents a large number of users' interactions with regards to coping with cancer.
background_label: Sentiment analysis is an important step in understanding participants' needs and concerns and the impact of users' responses on other members.
method_label: We present an automated approach for sentiment analysis in an online cancer survivor community and compare it with a previous sentiment analysis approach.
method_label: Both approaches are machine learning based and are tested on the same dataset.
method_label: However, this work uses features derived from a dynamic sentiment lexicon, whereas the previous work uses a general sentiment lexicon to extract features.
result_label: Tested on several classifiers, with only six features (versus thirteen), our results show 2.3% improvement on average, in terms of accuracy, and greater improvement in F-measure and AUC.
result_label: An additional experiment was conducted that showed a positive impact of dimensionality reduction by extracting abstract features, instead of using term frequency (TF) vector space as attribute values.

TITLE: A Non-negative Matrix Tri-factorization Approach to Sentiment Classification with Lexical Prior Knowledge
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment classification refers to the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a subject at hand.
background_label: The proliferation of user-generated web content such as blogs, discussion forums and online review sites has made it possible to perform large-scale mining of public opinion.
background_label: Sentiment modeling is thus becoming a critical component of market intelligence and social media technologies that aim to tap into the collective wisdom of crowds.
objective_label: In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-quality sentiment models with minimal manual supervision.
method_label: We propose a novel approach to learn from lexical prior knowledge in the form of domain-independent sentiment-laden terms, in conjunction with domain-dependent unlabeled data and a few labeled documents.
method_label: Our model is based on a constrained non-negative tri-factorization of the term-document matrix which can be implemented using simple update rules.
result_label: Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of real-world sentiment prediction tasks.

TITLE: Sentiment analyzer: extracting sentiments about a given topic using natural language processing techniques
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present sentiment analyzer (SA) that extracts sentiment (or opinion) about a subject from online text documents.
method_label: Instead of classifying the sentiment of an entire document about a subject, SA detects all references to the given subject, and determines sentiment in each of the references using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
method_label: Our sentiment analysis consists of 1) a topic specific feature term extraction, 2) sentiment extraction, and 3) (subject, sentiment) association by relationship analysis.
method_label: SA utilizes two linguistic resources for the analysis: the sentiment lexicon and the sentiment pattern database.
result_label: The performance of the algorithms was verified on online product review articles ("digital camera" and "music" reviews), and more general documents including general Webpages and news articles.

TITLE: Modelling Sarcasm in Twitter, a Novel Approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: Automatic detection of figurative language is a challenging task in computational linguistics.
background_label: Recognising both literal and figurative meaning is not trivial for a machine and in some cases it is hard even for humans.
background_label: For this reason novel and accurate systems able to recognise figurative languages are necessary.
objective_label: We present in this paper a novel computational model capable to detect sarcasm in the social network Twitter (a popular microblogging service which allows users to post short messages).
method_label: Our model is easy to implement and, unlike previous systems, it does not include patterns of words as features.
result_label: Our seven sets of lexical features aim to detect sarcasm by its inner structure (for example unexpectedness, intensity of the terms or imbalance between registers), abstracting from the use of specific terms.

TITLE: A Simple Approach to Multilingual Polarity Classification in Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the interest in mining opinions of social media users.
background_label: Sentiment analysis consists in determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness or negativeness.
background_label: Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been tailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of lexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content.
objective_label: In this contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use multilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis contests, and as starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems.
method_label: We compare our approach in eight different languages, three of them have important international contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and SENTIPOLC (Italian).
result_label: Within the competitions our approach reaches from medium to high positions in the rankings; whereas in the remaining languages our approach outperforms the reported results.

TITLE: Prediction of election result by enhanced sentiment analysis on twitter data using classifier ensemble Approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis is the computational study of opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, views and emotions expressed in text.
objective_label: It refers to a classification problem where the main focus is to predict the polarity of words and then classify them into positive or negative sentiment.
background_label: Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers people a fast and effective way to measure the public's feelings towards their party and politicians.
objective_label: The primary issue in previous sentiment analysis techniques is the determination of the most appropriate classifier for a given classification problem.
method_label: If one classifier is chosen from the available classifiers, then there is no surety in the best performance on unseen data.
result_label: So to reduce the risk of selecting an inappropriate classifier, we are combining the outputs of a set of classifiers.
background_label: Thus in this paper, we use an approach that automatically classifies the sentiment of tweets by combining machine learning classifiers with lexicon based classifier.
method_label: The new combination of classifiers are SentiWordNet classifier, naive bayes classifier and hidden markov model classifier.
method_label: Here positivity or negativity of each tweet is determined by using the majority voting principle on the result of these three classifiers.
method_label: Thus we were used this sentiment classifier for finding political sentiment from real time tweets.
result_label: Thus we have got an improved accuracy in sentiment analysis using classifier ensemble Approach.
result_label: Our method also uses negation handling and word sense disambiguation to achieve high accuracy.

TITLE: A sentiment polarity prediction model using transfer learning and its application to SNS flaming event detection
ABSTRACT: background_label: In recent years, with the popularization of SNS, the incidents called flaming, in which a large number of negative comments are retweeted and spread to many followers on SNS, are increasing.
background_label: Since a flaming event sometimes causes severe criticism by public people, it is becoming a great thread to companies and therefore it is important for companies to protect their reputation from such flaming events.
method_label: In order to protect companies from serious damages in reputation, we propose a machine learning approach to the detection of flaming events by monitoring the sentiment polarity of SNS comments.
method_label: From the nature of SNS comments such as the spread of a large number of retweets with the same content for a short time, the word distributions are often strongly biased and it leads to poor performance in sentiment polarity prediction.
method_label: To alleviate this problem, we introduce transfer learning into the conventional Naive Bayes classifier.
method_label: More concretely, in the Naive Bayes classifier, the occurrence probabilities of words on a target domain are recalculated using those on other domains, where a domain corresponds to a company to be protected.
result_label: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transfer learning contribute to the improvement in the sentiment polarity prediction for SNS comments.
result_label: In addition, we show that the proposed system can detect flaming events correctly by monitoring the number of negative comments.

TITLE: A semi-supervised approach to sentiment analysis using revised sentiment strength based on SentiWordNet
ABSTRACT: background_label: An immense amount of data is available with the advent of social media in the last decade.
background_label: This data can be used for sentiment analysis and decision making.
background_label: The data present on blogs, news/review sites, social networks, etc., are so enormous that manual labeling is not feasible and an automatic approach is required for its analysis.
background_label: The sentiment of the masses can be understood by analyzing this large scale and opinion rich data.
background_label: The major issues in the application of automated approaches are data unavailability, data sparsity, domain independence and inadequate performance.
method_label: This research proposes a semi-supervised sentiment analysis approach that incorporates lexicon-based methodology with machine learning in order to improve sentiment analysis performance.
method_label: Mathematical models such as information gain and cosine similarity are employed to revise the sentiment scores defined in SentiWordNet.
method_label: This research also emphasizes on the importance of nouns and employs them as semantic features with other parts of speech.
result_label: The evaluation of performance measures and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques proves that the proposed approach is superior.

TITLE: Self-Attention: A Better Building Block for Sentiment Analysis Neural Network Classifiers
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment Analysis has seen much progress in the past two decades.
background_label: For the past few years, neural network approaches, primarily RNNs and CNNs, have been the most successful for this task.
background_label: Recently, a new category of neural networks, self-attention networks (SANs), have been created which utilizes the attention mechanism as the basic building block.
background_label: Self-attention networks have been shown to be effective for sequence modeling tasks, while having no recurrence or convolutions.
objective_label: In this work we explore the effectiveness of the SANs for sentiment analysis.
result_label: We demonstrate that SANs are superior in performance to their RNN and CNN counterparts by comparing their classification accuracy on six datasets as well as their model characteristics such as training speed and memory consumption.
result_label: Finally, we explore the effects of various SAN modifications such as multi-head attention as well as two methods of incorporating sequence position information into SANs.

TITLE: Joint sentiment/topic model for sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis or opinion mining aims to use automated tools to detect subjective information such as opinions, attitudes, and feelings expressed in text.
objective_label: This paper proposes a novel probabilistic modeling framework based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), called joint sentiment/topic model (JST), which detects sentiment and topic simultaneously from text.
method_label: Unlike other machine learning approaches to sentiment classification which often require labeled corpora for classifier training, the proposed JST model is fully unsupervised.
method_label: The model has been evaluated on the movie review dataset to classify the review sentiment polarity and minimum prior information have also been explored to further improve the sentiment classification accuracy.
result_label: Preliminary experiments have shown promising results achieved by JST.

TITLE: Learning Stock Market Sentiment Lexicon and Sentiment-Oriented Word Vector from StockTwits
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractPrevious studies have shown that investor sentiment indicators can predict stock market change.
background_label: A domain-specific sentiment lexicon and sentiment-oriented word embedding model would help the sentiment analysis in financial domain and stock market.
objective_label: In this paper, we present a new approach to learning stock market lexicon from StockTwits, a popular financial social network for investors to share ideas.
method_label: It learns word polarity by predicting message sentiment, using a neural network.The sentiment-oriented word embeddings are learned from tens of millions of StockTwits posts, and this is the first study presenting sentiment-oriented word embeddings for stock market.
result_label: The experiments of predicting investor sentiment show that our lexicon outperformed other lexicons built by the state-of-the-art methods, and the sentiment-oriented word vector was much better than the general word embeddings.

TITLE: Open Domain Targeted Sentiment
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractWe propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting.
background_label: The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity.
objective_label: This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them.
method_label: We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource.
result_label: By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction.
result_label: Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.

TITLE: How do Negation and Modality Impact on Opinions?
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractIn this paper, we propose to study the effects of negation and modality on opinion expressions.
background_label: Based on linguistic experiments informed by native speakers, we distill these effects according to the type of modality and negation.
method_label: We show that each type has a specific effect on the opinion expression in its scope: both on the polarity and the strength for negation, and on the strength and/or the degree of certainty for modality.
result_label: The empirical results reported in this paper provide a basis for future opinion analysis systems that have to compute the sentiment orientation at the sentence or at the clause level.
method_label: The methodology we used for deriving this basis was applied for French but it can be easily instantiated for other languages like English.

TITLE: Turning Words Into Consumer Preferences: How Sentiment Analysis Is Framed in Research and the News Media:
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis is an increasingly popular instrument for the analysis of social media discourse.
background_label: Sentiment scores seemingly represent an objective means of assessing the mood of social media users, consumers, and the public at large.
background_label: Similar to other computational tools, sentiment analysis promises to reduce complexity and mitigate information overload, and to inform the decisions of marketers, pollsters, and scholars with reliable data.
method_label: This article argues that the assumptions encoded into sentiment analysis as a method are accompanied by a number of constraints, both regarding its technical limitations (in terms of what sentiment analysis can and cannot accomplish) and conceptually (in terms of what the notion of sentiment implicitly represents), constraints which are often de-emphasized in public discourse.
method_label: After providing an overview of its history and development in computer science as well as psychology and the social sciences, we turn to the role of sentiment as a currency in the attention economy.
method_label: We then present a brief study of common framing of sentiment analysis in the news media, highlighting the expectations that exist regarding its analytical capabilities.
result_label: We close by discussing the kind of conceptual work that takes place around computational methods such as sentiment analysis in specific cultural environments, highlighting their influence on the public imaginary.

TITLE: Semi-supervised and Transfer learning approaches for low resource sentiment classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment classification involves quantifying the affective reaction of a human to a document, media item or an event.
background_label: Although researchers have investigated several methods to reliably infer sentiment from lexical, speech and body language cues, training a model with a small set of labeled datasets is still a challenge.
background_label: For instance, in expanding sentiment analysis to new languages and cultures, it may not always be possible to obtain comprehensive labeled datasets.
objective_label: In this paper, we investigate the application of semi-supervised and transfer learning methods to improve performances on low resource sentiment classification tasks.
method_label: We experiment with extracting dense feature representations, pre-training and manifold regularization in enhancing the performance of sentiment classification systems.
result_label: Our goal is a coherent implementation of these methods and we evaluate the gains achieved by these methods in matched setting involving training and testing on a single corpus setting as well as two cross corpora settings.
result_label: In both the cases, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly enhance the model performance against a purely supervised approach, particularly in cases involving a handful of training data.

TITLE: A Multi-sentiment-resource Enhanced Attention Network for Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Deep learning approaches for sentiment classification do not fully exploit sentiment linguistic knowledge.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a Multi-sentiment-resource Enhanced Attention Network (MEAN) to alleviate the problem by integrating three kinds of sentiment linguistic knowledge (e.g., sentiment lexicon, negation words, intensity words) into the deep neural network via attention mechanisms.
method_label: By using various types of sentiment resources, MEAN utilizes sentiment-relevant information from different representation subspaces, which makes it more effective to capture the overall semantics of the sentiment, negation and intensity words for sentiment prediction.
result_label: The experimental results demonstrate that MEAN has robust superiority over strong competitors.

TITLE: Ensemble of Generative and Discriminative Techniques for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing that aims to detect polarity of a text document (typically a consumer review).
method_label: In the simplest settings, we discriminate only between positive and negative sentiment, turning the task into a standard binary classification problem.
method_label: We compare several ma- chine learning approaches to this problem, and combine them to achieve the best possible results.
method_label: We show how to use for this task the standard generative lan- guage models, which are slightly complementary to the state of the art techniques.
result_label: We achieve strong results on a well-known dataset of IMDB movie reviews.
result_label: Our results are easily reproducible, as we publish also the code needed to repeat the experiments.
result_label: This should simplify further advance of the state of the art, as other researchers can combine their techniques with ours with little effort.

TITLE: Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification Using Sentiment Sensitive Embeddings
ABSTRACT: background_label: Unsupervised Cross-domain Sentiment Classification is the task of adapting a sentiment classifier trained on a particular domain (source domain), to a different domain (target domain), without requiring any labeled data for the target domain.
background_label: By adapting an existing sentiment classifier to previously unseen target domains, we can avoid the cost for manual data annotation for the target domain.
method_label: We model this problem as embedding learning, and construct three objective functions that capture: (a) distributional properties of  pivots (i.e., common features that appear in both source and target domains), (b) label constraints in the source domain documents, and (c) geometric properties in the unlabeled documents in both source and target domains.
method_label: Unlike prior proposals that first learn a lower-dimensional embedding independent of the source domain sentiment labels, and next a sentiment classifier in this embedding, our joint optimisation method learns embeddings that are sensitive to sentiment classification.
result_label: Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that by jointly optimising the three objectives we can obtain better performances in comparison to optimising each objective function separately, thereby demonstrating the importance of task-specific embedding learning for cross-domain sentiment classification.
result_label: Among the individual objective functions, the best performance is obtained by (c).
result_label: Moreover, the proposed method reports cross-domain sentiment classification accuracies that are statistically comparable to the current state-of-the-art embedding learning methods for cross-domain sentiment classification.

TITLE: Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques
ABSTRACT: background_label: We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative.
background_label: Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines.
method_label: However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization.
result_label: We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.

TITLE: Sentiment Analysis of Conditional Sentences
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper studies sentiment analysis of conditional sentences.
objective_label: The aim is to determine whether opinions expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence are positive, negative or neutral.
objective_label: Conditional sentences are one of the commonly used language constructs in text.
background_label: In a typical document, there are around 8% of such sentences.
background_label: Due to the condition clause, sentiments expressed in a conditional sentence can be hard to determine.
background_label: For example, in the sentence, if your Nokia phone is not good, buy this great Samsung phone, the author is positive about "Samsung phone" but does not express an opinion on "Nokia phone" (although the owner of the "Nokia phone" may be negative about it).
method_label: However, if the sentence does not have "if', the first clause is clearly negative.
method_label: Although "if' commonly signifies a conditional sentence, there are many other words and constructs that can express conditions.
method_label: This paper first presents a linguistic analysis of such sentences, and then builds some supervised learning models to determine if sentiments expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence are positive, negative or neutral.
result_label: Experimental results on conditional sentences from 5 diverse domains are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TITLE: Learning with Compositional Semantics as Structural Inference for Subsentential Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Determining the polarity of a sentiment-bearing expression requires more than a simple bag-of-words approach.
background_label: In particular, words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity.
objective_label: In this paper, we view such subsentential interactions in light of compositional semantics, and present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure.
method_label: Our experiments show that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics can perform better than learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (accuracy of 89.7% vs. 89.1%), but (2) a method that integrates compositional semantics into learning performs better than all other alternatives (90.7%).
result_label: We also find that "content-word negators", not widely employed in previous work, play an important role in determining expression-level polarity.
result_label: Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy uniformly decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered.

TITLE: Precise tweet classification and sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: The rise of social media in couple of years has changed the general perspective of networking, socialization, and personalization.
background_label: Use of data from social networks for different purposes, such as election prediction, sentimental analysis, marketing, communication, business, and education, is increasing day by day.
background_label: Precise extraction of valuable information from short text messages posted on social media (Twitter) is a collaborative task.
method_label: In this paper, we analyze tweets to classify data and sentiments from Twitter more precisely.
method_label: The information from tweets are extracted using keyword based knowledge extraction.
background_label: Moreover, the extracted knowledge is further enhanced using domain specific seed based enrichment technique.
method_label: The proposed methodology facilitates the extraction of keywords, entities, synonyms, and parts of speech from tweets which are then used for tweets classification and sentimental analysis.
method_label: The proposed system is tested on a collection of 40,000 tweets.
method_label: The proposed methodology has performed better than the existing system in terms of tweets classification and sentiment analysis.
result_label: By applying the Knowledge Enhancer and Synonym Binder module on the extracted information we have achieved increase in information gain in a range of 0.1% to 55%.
result_label: The increase in information gain has enabled our proposed system to better summarize the twitter data for user sentiments regarding a keyword from a particular category.

background_label: Both models leverage abundant natural supervision in the form of review ratings, as well as a small amount of manually crafted sentence labels, to learn sentence-level sentiment classifiers.
method_label: The proposed model is a fusion of a fully supervised structured conditional model and its partially supervised counterpart.
method_label: This allows for highly efficient estimation and inference algorithms with rich feature definitions.
result_label: We describe the two variants as well as their component models and verify experimentally that both variants give significantly improved results for sentence-level sentiment analysis compared to all baselines.

TITLE: Predicting exchange rates with sentiment indicators: An empirical evaluation using text mining and multilayer perceptrons
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent innovations in text mining facilitate the use of novel data for sentiment analysis related to financial markets, and promise new approaches to the field of behavioural finance.
background_label: Traditionally, text mining has allowed a near-real time analysis of available news feeds.
background_label: The recent dissemination of web 2.0 has seen a drastic increase of user participation, providing comments on websites, social networks and blogs, creating a novel source of rich and personal sentiment data potentially of value to behavioural finance.
objective_label: This study explores the efficacy of using novel sentiment indicators from MarketPsych, which analyses social media in addition to newsfeeds to quantify various levels of individual's emotions, as a predictor for financial time series returns of the Australian Dollar (AUD) - US Dollar (USD) exchange rate.
objective_label: As one of the first studies evaluating both news and social media sentiment indicators as explanatory variables for linear and nonlinear regression algorithms, our study aims to make an original contribution to behavioural finance, combining technical and behavioural aspects of model building.
method_label: An empirical out-of-sample evaluation with multiple input structures compares multivariate linear regression models (MLR) with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for descriptive modelling.
result_label: The results indicate that sentiment indicators are explanatory for market movements of exchange rate returns, with nonlinear MLPs showing superior accuracy over linear regression models with a directional out-of-sample accuracy of 60.26% using cross validation.

TITLE: SEntiMoji: An Emoji-Powered Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis has various application scenarios in software engineering (SE), such as detecting developers' emotions in commit messages and identifying their opinions on Q&A forums.
background_label: However, commonly used out-of-the-box sentiment analysis tools cannot obtain reliable results on SE tasks and the misunderstanding of technical jargon is demonstrated to be the main reason.
method_label: Then, researchers have to utilize labeled SE-related texts to customize sentiment analysis for SE tasks via a variety of algorithms.
background_label: However, the scarce labeled data can cover only very limited expressions and thus cannot guarantee the analysis quality.
result_label: To address such a problem, we turn to the easily available emoji usage data for help.
background_label: More specifically, we employ emotional emojis as noisy labels of sentiments and propose a representation learning approach that uses both Tweets and GitHub posts containing emojis to learn sentiment-aware representations for SE-related texts.
method_label: These emoji-labeled posts can not only supply the technical jargon, but also incorporate more general sentiment patterns shared across domains.
method_label: They as well as labeled data are used to learn the final sentiment classifier.
method_label: Compared to the existing sentiment analysis methods used in SE, the proposed approach can achieve significant improvement on representative benchmark datasets.
result_label: By further contrast experiments, we find that the Tweets make a key contribution to the power of our approach.
result_label: This finding informs future research not to unilaterally pursue the domain-specific resource, but try to transform knowledge from the open domain through ubiquitous signals such as emojis.

TITLE: Sentiment Analysis: How to Derive Prior Polarities from SentiWordNet
ABSTRACT: background_label: Assigning a positive or negative score to a word out of context (i.e.
background_label: a word's prior polarity) is a challenging task for sentiment analysis.
background_label: In the literature, various approaches based on SentiWordNet have been proposed.
method_label: In this paper, we compare the most often used techniques together with newly proposed ones and incorporate all of them in a learning framework to see whether blending them can further improve the estimation of prior polarity scores.
method_label: Using two different versions of SentiWordNet and testing regression and classification models across tasks and datasets, our learning approach consistently outperforms the single metrics, providing a new state-of-the-art approach in computing words' prior polarity for sentiment analysis.
result_label: We conclude our investigation showing interesting biases in calculated prior polarity scores when word Part of Speech and annotator gender are considered.

TITLE: Monday mornings are my fave : ) #not Exploring the Automatic Recognition of Irony in English tweets
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractRecognising and understanding irony is crucial for the improvement natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis.
objective_label: In this study, we describe the construction of an English Twitter corpus and its annotation for irony based on a newly developed fine-grained annotation scheme.
method_label: We also explore the feasibility of automatic irony recognition by exploiting a varied set of features including lexical, syntactic, sentiment and semantic (Word2Vec) information.
result_label: Experiments on a held-out test set show that our irony classifier benefits from this combined information, yielding an F 1 -score of 67.66%.
result_label: When explicit hashtag information like #irony is included in the data, the system even obtains an F 1 -score of 92.77%.
result_label: A qualitative analysis of the output reveals that recognising irony that results from a polarity clash appears to be (much) more feasible than recognising other forms of ironic utterances (e.g., descriptions of situational irony).

TITLE: From bias to opinion: a transfer-learning approach to real-time sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Real-time interaction, which enables live discussions, has become a key feature of most Web applications.
background_label: In such an environment, the ability to automatically analyze user opinions and sentiments as discussions develop is a powerful resource known as real time sentiment analysis.
background_label: However, this task comes with several challenges, including the need to deal with highly dynamic textual content that is characterized by changes in vocabulary and its subjective meaning and the lack of labeled data needed to support supervised classifiers.
method_label: In this paper, we propose a transfer learning strategy to perform real time sentiment analysis.
method_label: We identify a task - opinion holder bias prediction - which is strongly related to the sentiment analysis task; however, in constrast to sentiment analysis, it builds accurate models since the underlying relational data follows a stationary distribution.
method_label: Instead of learning textual models to predict content polarity (i.e., the traditional sentiment analysis approach), we first measure the bias of social media users toward a topic, by solving a relational learning task over a network of users connected by endorsements (e.g., retweets in Twitter).
method_label: We then analyze sentiments by transferring user biases to textual features.
method_label: This approach works because while new terms may arise and old terms may change their meaning, user bias tends to be more consistent over time as a basic property of human behavior.
method_label: Thus, we adopted user bias as the basis for building accurate classification models.
method_label: We applied our model to posts collected from Twitter on two topics: the 2010 Brazilian Presidential Elections and the 2010 season of Brazilian Soccer League.
result_label: Our results show that knowing the bias of only 10% of users generates an F1 accuracy level ranging from 80% to 90% in predicting user sentiment in tweets.

TITLE: A Statistical Parsing Framework for Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a statistical parsing framework for sentence-level sentiment classification in this article.
background_label: Unlike previous works that employ syntactic parsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to directly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence.
method_label: We show that complicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification, and contrast) can be handled the same as simple and straightforward sentiment expressions in a unified and probabilistic way.
method_label: We formulate the sentiment grammar upon Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), and provide a formal description of the sentiment parsing framework.
method_label: We develop the parsing model to obtain possible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is proposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model is dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree.
method_label: We train the parser directly from examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but without any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents within sentences.
method_label: Therefore we can obtain training data easily.
method_label: In particular, we train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences with users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels.
result_label: Extensive experiments on existing benchmark datasets show significant improvements over baseline sentiment classification approaches.

TITLE: Boost Phrase-level Polarity Labelling with Review-level Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis on user reviews helps to keep track of user reactions towards products, and make advices to users about what to buy.
background_label: State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good precisions of above 90%.
background_label: However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around 70%~80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks.
objective_label: In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis.
method_label: We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews.
method_label: Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true.
method_label: We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework.
method_label: Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity.
result_label: Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.

TITLE: UNITN: Training Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Twitter Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper describes our deep learning system for sentiment analysis of tweets.
objective_label: The main contribution of this work is a process to initialize the parameter weights of the convolutional neural network, which is crucial to train an accurate model while avoiding the need to inject any additional features.
method_label: Briefly, we use an unsupervised neural language model to initialize word embeddings that are further tuned by our deep learning model on a distant supervised corpus.
method_label: At a final stage, the pre-trained parameters of the network are used to initialize the model which is then trained on the supervised training data from Semeval-2015.
result_label: According to results on the official test sets, our model ranks 1st in the phrase-level subtask A (among 11 teams) and 2nd on the messagelevel subtask B (among 40 teams).
result_label: Interestingly, computing an average rank over all six test sets (official and five progress test sets) puts our system 1st in both subtasks A and B.

TITLE: Comprehensive Study on Lexicon-based Ensemble Classification Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Abstract:We propose a novel method for counting sentiment orientation that outperforms supervised learning approaches in time and memory complexity and is not statistically significantly different from them in accuracy.
method_label: Our method consists of a novel approach to generating unigram, bigram and trigram lexicons.
method_label: The proposed method, called frequentiment, is based on calculating the frequency of features (words) in the document and averaging their impact on the sentiment score as opposed to documents that do not contain these features.
method_label: Afterwards, we use ensemble classification to improve the overall accuracy of the method.
method_label: What is important is that the frequentiment-based lexicons with sentiment threshold selection outperform other popular lexicons and some supervised learners, while being 3-5 times faster than the supervised approach.
method_label: We compare 37 methods (lexicons, ensembles with lexicon's predictions as input and supervised learners) applied to 10 Amazon review data sets and provide the first statistical comparison of the sentiment annotation methods that include ensemble approaches.
result_label: It is one of the most comprehensive comparisons of domain sentiment analysis in the literature.

TITLE: Reducing Gender Bias in Abusive Language Detection
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abusive language detection models tend to have a problem of being biased toward identity words of a certain group of people because of imbalanced training datasets.
background_label: For example,"You are a good woman"was considered"sexist"when trained on an existing dataset.
background_label: Such model bias is an obstacle for models to be robust enough for practical use.
method_label: In this work, we measure gender biases on models trained with different abusive language datasets, while analyzing the effect of different pre-trained word embeddings and model architectures.
method_label: We also experiment with three bias mitigation methods: (1) debiased word embeddings, (2) gender swap data augmentation, and (3) fine-tuning with a larger corpus.
result_label: These methods can effectively reduce gender bias by 90-98% and can be extended to correct model bias in other scenarios.

TITLE: What are Sentiment, Affect, and Emotion? Applying the Methodology of Michael Zock to Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: In Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics (NLP or CL), researchers assume almost universally that speakers hold some affective value or sentiment with regard to (some aspects of) a topic such as a film or camera, that this sentiment has a fixed value (typically, something like good or bad), and that the sentiment is expressed in text through a word or small combination of words.
background_label: However, one finds in the NLP literature essentially no discussion about what ‘sentiment’ or ‘opinion’ really is, how it is expressed in actual language usage, how the expressing words are organized and found in the lexicon, and how in fact one can empirically verify cognitive claims, if any, implied in or assumed by an NLP implementation.
background_label: Even the Wikipedia definition, which is a little more careful than most of the NLP literature, uses words like “polarity”, “affective state”, and “emotional effect” without definition.
objective_label: In this situation we can usefully try to duplicate Michael’s mindset and approach.
objective_label: What do people actually do?
other_label: How does what they do illustrate the complexities of the problem and disclose unusual and interesting aspects that computer scientists are simply blind to?
method_label: In this paper I first provide interesting examples of real-world usage, then explore some definitions of sentiment, affect, opinion, and emotion, and conclude with a few suggestions for how computational studies might address the problem in a more informed way.
result_label: I hope in the paper to follow the spirit of Michael’s research, in recognizing that there is much more to language usage than simply making some computer system mimic some annotated corpus, and that one can learn valuable lessons for NLP by looking at what people do when they make language.

TITLE: Sentiment Classification of Reviews Using SentiWordNet
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment classification concerns the use of automatic methods for predicting the orientation of subjective content on text documents, with applications on a number of areas including recommender and advertising systems, customer intelligence and information retrieval.
background_label: SentiWordNet is an opinion lexicon derived from the WordNet database where each term is associated with numerical scores indicating positive and negative sentiment information.
objective_label: This research presents the results of applying the SentiWordNet lexical resource to the problem of automatic sentiment classification of film reviews.
method_label: Our approach comprises counting positive and negative term scores to determine sentiment orientation, and an improvement is presented by building a data set of relevant features using SentiWordNet as source, and applied to a machine learning classifier.
result_label: We find that results obtained with SentiWordNet are in line with similar approaches using manual lexicons seen in the literature.
result_label: In addition, our feature set approach yielded improvements over the baseline term counting method.
result_label: The results indicate SentiWordNet could be used as an important resource for sentiment classification tasks.
result_label: Additional considerations are made on possible further improvements to the method and its use in conjunction with other techniques.

TITLE: Using Multiple Sources to Construct a Sentiment Sensitive Thesaurus for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains.
method_label: We automatically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains.
method_label: The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier.
method_label: Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains.
result_label: Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.

ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper addresses a new task in sentiment classification, called multi-domain sentiment classification, that aims to improve performance through fusing training data from multiple domains.

result_label: Experimental studies show that multi-domain sentiment classification using the classifier-level approach performs much better than single domain classification (using the training data individually).

TITLE: Using Hadoop for Large Scale Analysis on Twitter: A Technical Report
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently.
background_label: One of the system's key features, is the immediacy in communication with other users in an easy, user-friendly and fast way.
background_label: Consequently, people tend to express their feelings freely, which makes Twitter an ideal source for accumulating a vast amount of opinions towards a wide diversity of topics.
background_label: This amount of information offers huge potential and can be harnessed to receive the sentiment tendency towards these topics.
background_label: However, since none can invest an infinite amount of time to read through these tweets, an automated decision making approach is necessary.
result_label: Nevertheless, most existing solutions are limited in centralized environments only.
background_label: Thus, they can only process at most a few thousand tweets.
background_label: Such a sample, is not representative to define the sentiment polarity towards a topic due to the massive number of tweets published daily.
method_label: In this paper, we go one step further and develop a novel method for sentiment learning in the MapReduce framework.
method_label: Our algorithm exploits the hashtags and emoticons inside a tweet, as sentiment labels, and proceeds to a classification procedure of diverse sentiment types in a parallel and distributed manner.
method_label: Moreover, we utilize Bloom filters to compact the storage size of intermediate data and boost the performance of our algorithm.
result_label: Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we prove that our solution is efficient, robust and scalable and confirm the quality of our sentiment identification.

TITLE: Large Scale Implementations for Twitter Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data is indeed a challenging problem due to the nature, diversity and volume of the data.
background_label: People tend to express their feelings freely, which makes Twitter an ideal source for accumulating a vast amount of opinions towards a wide spectrum of topics.
background_label: This amount of information offers huge potential and can be harnessed to receive the sentiment tendency towards these topics.
background_label: However, since no one can invest an infinite amount of time to read through these tweets, an automated decision making approach is necessary.
background_label: Nevertheless, most existing solutions are limited in centralized environments only.
result_label: Thus, they can only process at most a few thousand tweets.
background_label: Such a sample is not representative in order to define the sentiment polarity towards a topic due to the massive number of tweets published daily.
objective_label: In this work, we develop two systems: the first in the MapReduce and the second in the Apache Spark framework for programming with Big Data.
method_label: The algorithm exploits all hashtags and emoticons inside a tweet, as sentiment labels, and proceeds to a classification method of diverse sentiment types in a parallel and distributed manner.
method_label: Moreover, the sentiment analysis tool is based on Machine Learning methodologies alongside Natural Language Processing techniques and utilizes Apache Spark's Machine learning library, MLlib.
method_label: In order to address the nature of Big Data, we introduce some pre-processing steps for achieving better results in Sentiment Analysis as well as Bloom filters to compact the storage size of intermediate data and boost the performance of our algorithm.
result_label: Finally, the proposed system was trained and validated with real data crawled by Twitter, and, through an extensive experimental evaluation, we prove that our solution is efficient, robust and scalable while confirming the quality of our sentiment identification.

TITLE: Automatic Identification Of Sentiment Vocabulary: Exploiting Low Association With Known Sentiment Terms
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe an extension to the technique for the automatic identification and labeling of sentiment terms described in Turney (2002) and Turney and Littman (2002).
background_label: Their basic assumption is that sentiment terms of similar orientation tend to co-occur at the document level.
method_label: We add a second assumption, namely that sentiment terms of opposite orientation tend not to co-occur at the sentence level.
method_label: This additional assumption allows us to identify sentiment-bearing terms very reliably.
method_label: We then use these newly identified terms in various scenarios for the sentiment classification of sentences.
method_label: We show that our approach outperforms Turney's original approach.
method_label: Combining our approach with a Naive Bayes bootstrapping method yields a further small improvement of classifier performance.
result_label: We finally compare our results to precision and recall figures that can be obtained on the same data set with labeled data.

TITLE: Irony, Sarcasm, and Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Irony and sarcasm are sophisticated forms of speech in which authors write the opposite of what they mean.
background_label: They have been studied in linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science.
background_label: While irony is often used to emphasize occurrences that deviate from the expected, sarcasm is commonly used to convey implicit criticism.
background_label: However, the detection of irony and sarcasm is a complex task, even for humans.
background_label: The difficulty in recognizing irony and sarcasm causes misunderstanding in everyday communication and poses problems to many natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis.
result_label: This is particularly challenging when one is dealing with social media messages, where the language is concise, informal, and ill-formed.

TITLE: Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSemantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way.
background_label: Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition.
objective_label: To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank.
method_label: It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality.
method_label: To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network.
method_label: When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics.
method_label: It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%.
result_label: The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines.
result_label: Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.

TITLE: Revisiting the Importance of Encoding Logic Rules in Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: We analyze the performance of different sentiment classification models on syntactically complex inputs like A-but-B sentences.
background_label: The first contribution of this analysis addresses reproducible research: to meaningfully compare different models, their accuracies must be averaged over far more random seeds than what has traditionally been reported.
method_label: With proper averaging in place, we notice that the distillation model described in arXiv:1603.06318v4 [cs.LG], which incorporates explicit logic rules for sentiment classification, is ineffective.
method_label: In contrast, using contextualized ELMo embeddings (arXiv:1802.05365v2 [cs.CL]) instead of logic rules yields significantly better performance.
method_label: Additionally, we provide analysis and visualizations that demonstrate ELMo's ability to implicitly learn logic rules.
result_label: Finally, a crowdsourced analysis reveals how ELMo outperforms baseline models even on sentences with ambiguous sentiment labels.

TITLE: Sentiment Lexicon Interpolation and Polarity Estimation of Objective and Out-Of-Vocabulary Words to Improve Sentiment Classification on Microblogging
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSentiment analysis has become an important classification task because a large amount of user-generated content is published over the Internet.
background_label: Sentiment lexicons have been used successfully to classify the sentiment of user review datasets.
background_label: More recently, microblogging services such as Twitter have become a popular data source in the domain of sentiment analysis.
background_label: However, analyzing sentiments on tweets is still difficult because tweets are very short and contain slang, informal expressions, emoticons, mistyping and many words not found in a dictionary.
background_label: In addition, more than 90 percent of the words in public sentiment lexicons, such as SentiWordNet, are objective words, which are often considered less important in a classification module.
objective_label: In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that incorporates sentiment lexicons into a machine learning approach to improve sentiment classification in tweets.
method_label: We automatically construct an Add-on lexicon that compiles the polarity scores of objective words and out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words from tweet corpora.
method_label: We also introduce a novel feature weighting method by interpolating sentiment lexicon score into uni-gram vectors in the Support Vector Machine (SVM).
result_label: Results of our experiment show that our method is effective and significantly improves the sentiment classification accuracy compared to a baseline unigram model.

TITLE: Towards the Global SentiWordNet
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: The discipline where sentiment/opinion/emotion has been identified and classified in human written text is well known as sentiment analysis.
background_label: A typical computational approach to sentiment analysis starts with prior polarity lexicons where entries are tagged with their prior out of context polarity as human beings perceive using cognitive knowledge.
background_label: Till date, all research efforts found in sentiment analysis literature deal mostly with English texts.
objective_label: In this article, we propose an interactive gaming (Dr Sentiment) technology to create and validate SentiWordNet in 56 languages by involving Internet population.
method_label: Dr Sentiment is a fictitious character, interact with players using series of questions and finally reveal the behavioral or sentimental status of any player and store the lexicons as the players polarized during playing.
method_label: The interactive gaming technology is then compared with other multiple automatic linguistics techniques like, WordNet based, dictionary based, corpus based or generative approaches for generating SentiWordNet(s) for Indian languages and other International languages as well.
result_label: A number of automatic, semiautomatic and manual validations and evaluation methodologies have been adopted to measure the coverage and credibility of the developed SentiWordNet(s).

TITLE: SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn recent years, sentiment analysis in social media has attracted a lot of research interest and has been used for a number of applications.
background_label: Unfortunately, research has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets, complicating the comparison between approaches.
method_label: To address this issue, we have proposed SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, which included two subtasks: A, an expression-level subtask, and B, a messagelevel subtask.
method_label: We used crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk to label a large Twitter training dataset along with additional test sets of Twitter and SMS messages for both subtasks.
method_label: All datasets used in the evaluation are released to the research community.
result_label: The task attracted significant interest and a total of 149 submissions from 44 teams.
result_label: The bestperforming team achieved an F1 of 88.9% and 69% for subtasks A and B, respectively.

TITLE: Semantically Equivalent Adversarial Rules for Debugging NLP models
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractComplex machine learning models for NLP are often brittle, making different predictions for input instances that are extremely similar semantically.
background_label: To automatically detect this behavior for individual instances, we present semantically equivalent adversaries (SEAs) -semantic-preserving perturbations that induce changes in the model's predictions.
method_label: We generalize these adversaries into semantically equivalent adversarial rules (SEARs) -simple, universal replacement rules that induce adversaries on many instances.
method_label: We demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of SEAs and SEARs by detecting bugs in black-box state-of-the-art models for three domains: machine comprehension, visual questionanswering, and sentiment analysis.
result_label: Via user studies, we demonstrate that we generate high-quality local adversaries for more instances than humans, and that SEARs induce four times as many mistakes as the bugs discovered by human experts.
result_label: SEARs are also actionable: retraining models using data augmentation significantly reduces bugs, while maintaining accuracy.

TITLE: Diving Deep into Sentiment: Understanding Fine-tuned CNNs for Visual Sentiment Prediction
ABSTRACT: background_label: Visual media are powerful means of expressing emotions and sentiments.
background_label: The constant generation of new content in social networks highlights the need of automated visual sentiment analysis tools.
background_label: While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have established a new state-of-the-art in several vision problems, their application to the task of sentiment analysis is mostly unexplored and there are few studies regarding how to design CNNs for this purpose.
objective_label: In this work, we study the suitability of fine-tuning a CNN for visual sentiment prediction as well as explore performance boosting techniques within this deep learning setting.
result_label: Finally, we provide a deep-dive analysis into a benchmark, state-of-the-art network architecture to gain insight about how to design patterns for CNNs on the task of visual sentiment prediction.

TITLE: Learning Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding for Twitter Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a method that learns word embedding for Twitter sentiment classification in this paper.
background_label: Most existing algorithms for learning continuous word representations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment of text.
background_label: This is problematic for sentiment analysis as they usually map words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors.
objective_label: We address this issue by learning sentimentspecific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the continuous representation of words.
method_label: Specifically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g.
method_label: sentences or tweets) in their loss functions.
method_label: To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word embedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons.
result_label: Experiments on applying SSWE to a benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that (1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the top-performed system; (2) the performance is further improved by concatenating SSWE with existing feature set.

TITLE: A Novel approach of Sentiment Classification using Emoticons
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract Sentiment analysis is a technique that analyzes the attitudes and emotions of people towards some product, service etc.
background_label: Sentiment analysis of some product or service can be beneficial in predicting future scope of it.
background_label: However, manually analyzing a large number of documents in a limited time can be a tedious and challenging task.
background_label: Hence, several attempts have been made in the literature to solve this problem and several sentiment analysis techniques have been proposed.
background_label: However, these approaches do not consider or do not give much weighted to‘emoticons’ present in the sentence.
background_label: Emotions are very popular these days and have become an integral part of written communication.
method_label: Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, based on ‘emoticon score learning’ for identifying sentiment of a given sentence.
method_label: We test the proposed algorithm on 1000 tweets.
result_label: Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in sentiment classification and give accuracy of 91.1%.
result_label: Additionally, the proposed algorithm is able to detect sentences consisting of both positive and negative sentiments.

TITLE: Sentence compression for aspect-based sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis, which addresses the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has received considerable attention in recent years.
background_label: In contrast to the traditional coarse-grained sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment classification, we are interested in the fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis that aims to identify aspects that users comment on and these aspects' polarities.
background_label: Aspect-based sentiment analysis relies heavily on syntactic features.
background_label: However, the reviews that this task focuses on are natural and spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers.
method_label: In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent_Comp) step before performing the aspect-based sentiment analysis.
method_label: Different from the previous sentence compression model for common news sentences, Sent_Comp seeks to remove the sentiment-unnecessary information for sentiment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentiment sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse.
method_label: We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with certain special features, to automatically compress sentiment sentences.
method_label: Using the Chinese corpora of four product domains, Sent_Comp significantly improves the performance of the aspect-based sentiment analysis.
result_label: The features proposed for Sent_Comp, especially the potential semantic features, are useful for sentiment sentence compression.

TITLE: Sentiment-Specific Representation Learning for Document-Level Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: objective_label: In this paper, we propose a representation learning research framework for document-level sentiment analysis.
objective_label: Given a document as the input, document-level sentiment analysis aims to automatically classify its sentiment/opinion (such as thumbs up or thumbs down) based on the textural information.
background_label: Despite the success of feature engineering in many previous studies, the hand-coded features do not well capture the semantics of texts.
objective_label: In this research, we argue that learning sentiment-specific semantic representations of documents is crucial for document-level sentiment analysis.
method_label: We decompose the document semantics into four cascaded constitutes: (1) word representation, (2) sentence structure, (3) sentence composition and (4) document composition.
method_label: Specifically, we learn sentiment-specific word representations, which simultaneously encode the contexts of words and the sentiment supervisions of texts into the continuous representation space.
method_label: According to the principle of compositionality, we learn sentiment-specific sentence structures and sentence-level composition functions to produce the representation of each sentence based on the representations of the words it contains.
result_label: The semantic representations of documents are obtained through document composition, which leverages the sentiment-sensitive discourse relations and sentence representations.

TITLE: Construction of unsupervised sentiment classifier on idioms resources
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis is the computational study of how opinions, attitudes, emotions, and perspectives are expressed in language, and has been the important task of natural language processing.
background_label: Sentiment analysis is highly valuable for both research and practical applications.
objective_label: The focuses were put on the difficulties in the construction of sentiment classifiers which normally need tremendous labeled domain training data, and a novel unsupervised framework was proposed to make use of the Chinese idiom resources to develop a general sentiment classifier.
method_label: Furthermore, the domain adaption of general sentiment classifier was improved by taking the general classifier as the base of a self-training procedure to get a domain self-training sentiment classifier.
method_label: To validate the effect of the unsupervised framework, several experiments were carried out on publicly available Chinese online reviews dataset.
result_label: The experiments show that the proposed framework is effective and achieves encouraging results.
result_label: Specifically, the general classifier outperforms two baselines (a Naïve 50% baseline and a cross-domain classifier), and the bootstrapping self-training classifier approximates the upper bound domain-specific classifier with the lowest accuracy of 81.5%, but the performance is more stable and the framework needs no labeled training dataset.

TITLE: A cross-media public sentiment analysis system for microblog
ABSTRACT: background_label: Since classical public sentiment analysis systems for microblog are based on the text sentiment analysis, it is difficult to determine the sentiment of short text without clear sentiment words in microblog posts.
background_label: Fortunately, a lot of microblog posts contain images which also represent users’ sentiment.
objective_label: To fully understand users’ sentiment, we propose a cross-media public sentiment analysis system for microblog.
method_label: The best advantage of this novel system is the unified cross-media public sentiment analysis framework which fuses the text sentiment and image sentiment not only from sentiment results, but also from sentiment ontology.
method_label: To enhance presentation effects, this system presents sentiment results from macroscopic view and microscopic view which details the sentiment results in region, topic, microblog content and user diffusion.
result_label: In our knowledge, this is the first unified cross-media public sentiment analysis system.

TITLE: A document-level sentiment analysis approach using artificial neural network and sentiment lexicons
ABSTRACT: background_label: The abundance of discussion forums, Weblogs, e-commerce portals, social networking, product review sites and content sharing sites has facilitated flow of ideas and expression of opinions.
background_label: The user-generated text content on Internet and Web 2.0 social media can be a rich source of sentiments, opinions, evaluations, and reviews.
background_label: Sentiment analysis or opinion mining has become an open research domain that involves classifying text documents based on the opinion expressed, about a given topic, being positive or negative.
method_label: This paper proposes a sentiment classification model using back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN).
method_label: Information Gain, and three popular sentiment lexicons are used to extract sentiment representing features that are then used to train and test the BPANN.
method_label: This novel approach combines the strength of BPANN in classification accuracy with intrinsic subjectivity knowledge available in the sentiment lexicons.
result_label: The results obtained from experiments on the movie and hotel review corpora have shown that the proposed approach has been able to reduce dimensionality, while producing accurate results for sentiment based classification of text.

TITLE: Is Sentiment in Movies the Same as Sentiment in Psychotherapy? Comparisons Using a New Psychotherapy Sentiment Database
ABSTRACT: background_label: The sharing of emotional material is central to the process of psychotherapy and emotional problems are a primary reason for seeking treatment.
background_label: Surprisingly, very little systematic research has been done on patterns of emotional exchange during psychotherapy.
background_label: It is likely that a major reason for this void in the research is the enormous cost of annotating sessions for affective content.
objective_label: In the field of NLP, there have been major strides in the creation of algorithms for sentiment analysis, but most of this work has focused on written reviews of movies and twitter feeds with little work on spoken dialogue.
method_label: We have created a new database of 97,497 utterances from psychotherapy transcripts labeled by humans for sentiment.
method_label: We describe this dataset and present initial results for models identifying sentiment.
result_label: We also show that one of the best models from the literature, trained on movie reviews, performed below many of our baseline models that trained on the psychotherapy corpus.

TITLE: Consensus vote models for detecting and filtering neutrality in sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract Recently, interest in sentiment analysis has grown exponentially.
background_label: Many studies have developed a wide variety of algorithms capable of classifying texts according to the sentiment conveyed in them.
background_label: Such sentiment is usually expressed as positive, neutral or negative.
background_label: However, neutral reviews are often ignored in many sentiment analysis problems because of their ambiguity and lack of information.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose to empower neutrality by characterizing the boundary between positive and negative reviews, with the goal of improving the model’s performance.
method_label: We apply different sentiment analysis methods to different corpora extracting their sentiment and, hence, detecting neutral reviews by consensus to filter them, i.e., taking into account different models based on weighted aggregation.
method_label: We finally compare classification performance on single and aggregated models.
result_label: The results clearly show that aggregation methods outperform single models in most cases, which led us to conclude that neutrality is key for distinguishing between positive and negative and, then, for improving sentiment classification.

TITLE: Deep contextualized word representations
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).
method_label: Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus.
method_label: We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis.
result_label: We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.

TITLE: Colorless green recurrent networks dream hierarchically
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved impressive results in a variety of linguistic processing tasks, suggesting that they can induce non-trivial properties of language.
objective_label: We investigate here to what extent RNNs learn to track abstract hierarchical syntactic structure.
method_label: We test whether RNNs trained with a generic language modeling objective in four languages (Italian, English, Hebrew, Russian) can predict long-distance number agreement in various constructions.
method_label: We include in our evaluation nonsensical sentences where RNNs cannot rely on semantic or lexical cues ("The colorless green ideas I ate with the chair sleep furiously"), and, for Italian, we compare model performance to human intuitions.
result_label: Our language-model-trained RNNs make reliable predictions about long-distance agreement, and do not lag much behind human performance.
result_label: We thus bring support to the hypothesis that RNNs are not just shallow-pattern extractors, but they also acquire deeper grammatical competence.

ABSTRACT: background_label: We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based reasoning is essential.
background_label: However, we favor an approach that centers on one additional ingredient: autonomy.
objective_label: In particular, we aim toward agents that can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human hand-engineering.
method_label: We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not available.
result_label: Here we survey several important examples of the progress that has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities, and highlight some outstanding challenges.

TITLE: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
background_label: Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.
method_label: As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.
method_label: BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.
result_label: It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).

TITLE: A Meta-Framework for Modeling the Human Reading Process in Sentiment Analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article introduces a sentiment analysis approach that adopts the way humans read, interpret, and extract sentiment from text.
objective_label: Our motivation builds on the assumption that human interpretation should lead to the most accurate assessment of sentiment in text.
objective_label: We call this automated process Human Reading for Sentiment (HRS).
method_label: Previous research in sentiment analysis has produced many frameworks that can fit one or more of the HRS aspects; however, none of these methods has addressed them all in one approach.
method_label: HRS provides a meta-framework for developing new sentiment analysis methods or improving existing ones.
method_label: The proposed framework provides a theoretical lens for zooming in and evaluating aspects of any sentiment analysis method to identify gaps for improvements towards matching the human reading process.
method_label: Key steps in HRS include the automation of humans low-level and high-level cognitive text processing.
method_label: This methodology paves the way towards the integration of psychology with computational linguistics and machine learning to employ models of pragmatics and discourse analysis for sentiment analysis.
method_label: HRS is tested with two state-of-the-art methods; one is based on feature engineering, and the other is based on deep learning.
result_label: HRS highlighted the gaps in both methods and showed improvements for both.

TITLE: What you can cram into a single vector: Probing sentence embeddings for linguistic properties
ABSTRACT: background_label: Although much effort has recently been devoted to training high-quality sentence embeddings, we still have a poor understanding of what they are capturing.
background_label: "Downstream"tasks, often based on sentence classification, are commonly used to evaluate the quality of sentence representations.
background_label: The complexity of the tasks makes it however difficult to infer what kind of information is present in the representations.
method_label: We introduce here 10 probing tasks designed to capture simple linguistic features of sentences, and we use them to study embeddings generated by three different encoders trained in eight distinct ways, uncovering intriguing properties of both encoders and training methods.

TITLE: A Microphotonic Astrocomb
ABSTRACT: background_label: One of the essential prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers.
background_label: It has already been realized that the large number of exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as calibration light sources.
background_label: A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers.
method_label: Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23.7 GHz.
method_label: This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer.
result_label: As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research.

TITLE: Stress Test Evaluation for Natural Language Inference
ABSTRACT: background_label: Natural language inference (NLI) is the task of determining if a natural language hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise in a justifiable manner.
background_label: NLI was proposed as a benchmark task for natural language understanding.
background_label: Existing models perform well at standard datasets for NLI, achieving impressive results across different genres of text.
background_label: However, the extent to which these models understand the semantic content of sentences is unclear.
method_label: In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology consisting of automatically constructed"stress tests"that allow us to examine whether systems have the ability to make real inferential decisions.
result_label: Our evaluation of six sentence-encoder models on these stress tests reveals strengths and weaknesses of these models with respect to challenging linguistic phenomena, and suggests important directions for future work in this area.

TITLE: NRC-Canada: Building the State-of-the-Art in Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
ABSTRACT: method_label: In this paper, we describe how we created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and one to detect the sentiment of a term within a submissions stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task.
method_label: We implemented a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features.
method_label: with sentiment-word hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons.
result_label: In the message-level task, the lexicon-based features provided a gain of 5 F-score points over all others.
result_label: Both of our systems can be replicated us available resources.

TITLE: Assessing the Ability of LSTMs to Learn Syntax-Sensitive Dependencies
ABSTRACT: background_label: The success of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks in language processing is typically attributed to their ability to capture long-distance statistical regularities.
background_label: Linguistic regularities are often sensitive to syntactic structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which do not have explicit structural representations?
method_label: We begin addressing this question using number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies.
method_label: We probe the architecture's grammatical competence both using training objectives with an explicit grammatical target (number prediction, grammaticality judgments) and using language models.
method_label: In the strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achieved very high overall accuracy (less than 1% errors), but errors increased when sequential and structural information conflicted.
method_label: The frequency of such errors rose sharply in the language-modeling setting.
result_label: We conclude that LSTMs can capture a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targeted supervision, but stronger architectures may be required to further reduce errors; furthermore, the language modeling signal is insufficient for capturing syntax-sensitive dependencies, and should be supplemented with more direct supervision if such dependencies need to be captured.

TITLE: Summarizing Opinions: Aspect Extraction Meets Sentiment Prediction and They Are Both Weakly Supervised
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a neural framework for opinion summarization from online product reviews which is knowledge-lean and only requires light supervision (e.g., in the form of product domain labels and user-provided ratings).
method_label: Our method combines two weakly supervised components to identify salient opinions and form extractive summaries from multiple reviews: an aspect extractor trained under a multi-task objective, and a sentiment predictor based on multiple instance learning.
method_label: We introduce an opinion summarization dataset that includes a training set of product reviews from six diverse domains and human-annotated development and test sets with gold standard aspect annotations, salience labels, and opinion summaries.
result_label: Automatic evaluation shows significant improvements over baselines, and a large-scale study indicates that our opinion summaries are preferred by human judges according to multiple criteria.

TITLE: HotFlip: White-Box Adversarial Examples for Text Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose an efficient method to generate white-box adversarial examples to trick a character-level neural classifier.
method_label: We find that only a few manipulations are needed to greatly decrease the accuracy.
method_label: Our method relies on an atomic flip operation, which swaps one token for another, based on the gradients of the one-hot input vectors.
method_label: Due to efficiency of our method, we can perform adversarial training which makes the model more robust to attacks at test time.
result_label: With the use of a few semantics-preserving constraints, we demonstrate that HotFlip can be adapted to attack a word-level classifier as well.

TITLE: These are not the Stereotypes You are Looking For: Bias and Fairness in Authorial Gender Attribution
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractStylometric and text categorization results show that author gender can be discerned in texts with relatively high accuracy.
background_label: However, it is difficult to explain what gives rise to these results and there are many possible confounding factors, such as the domain, genre, and target audience of a text.
background_label: More fundamentally, such classification efforts risk invoking stereotyping and essentialism.
method_label: We explore this issue in two datasets of Dutch literary novels, using commonly used descriptive (LIWC, topic modeling) and predictive (machine learning) methods.
result_label: Our results show the importance of controlling for variables in the corpus and we argue for taking care not to overgeneralize from the results.

TITLE: Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Because of their superior ability to preserve sequence information over time, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network with a more complex computational unit, have obtained strong results on a variety of sequence modeling tasks.
background_label: The only underlying LSTM structure that has been explored so far is a linear chain.
background_label: However, natural language exhibits syntactic properties that would naturally combine words to phrases.
method_label: We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies.
result_label: Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).

TITLE: Automated Music Emotion Recognition: A Systematic Evaluation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract Automated music emotion recognition (MER) is a challenging task in Music Information Retrieval with wide-ranging applications.
background_label: Some recent studies pose MER as a continuous regression problem in the Arousal-Valence (AV) plane.
background_label: These consist of variations on a common architecture having a universal model of emotional response, a common repertoire of low-level audio features, a bag-of-frames approach to audio analysis, and relatively small data sets.
method_label: These approaches achieve some success at MER and suggest that further improvements are possible with current technology.
objective_label: Our contribution to the state of the art is to examine just how far one can go within this framework, and to investigate what the limitations of this framework are.
result_label: We present the results of a systematic study conducted in an attempt to maximize the prediction performance of an automated MER system using the architecture described.
result_label: We begin with a carefully constructed data set, emphasizing quality over quantity.

TITLE: A Comparison of Named Entity Recognition Tools Applied to Biographical Texts
ABSTRACT: background_label: Named entity recognition (NER) is a popular domain of natural language processing.
background_label: For this reason, many tools exist to perform this task.
background_label: Amongst other points, they differ in the processing method they rely upon, the entity types they can detect, the nature of the text they can handle, and their input/output formats.
background_label: This makes it difficult for a user to select an appropriate NER tool for a specific situation.
objective_label: In this article, we try to answer this question in the context of biographic texts.
background_label: For this matter, we first constitute a new corpus by annotating Wikipedia articles.
method_label: We then select publicly available, well known and free for research NER tools for comparison: Stanford NER, Illinois NET, OpenCalais NER WS and Alias-i LingPipe.
method_label: We apply them to our corpus, assess their performances and compare them.
result_label: When considering overall performances, a clear hierarchy emerges: Stanford has the best results, followed by LingPipe, Illionois and OpenCalais.
result_label: However, a more detailed evaluation performed relatively to entity types and article categories highlights the fact their performances are diversely influenced by those factors.
result_label: This complementarity opens an interesting perspective regarding the combination of these individual tools in order to improve performance.

TITLE: Opinion observer: analyzing and comparing opinions on the Web
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions.
background_label: There are now numerous Web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs.
objective_label: This paper focuses on online customer reviews of products.
objective_label: It makes two contributions.
method_label: First, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products.
method_label: A prototype system called Opinion Observer is also implemented.
background_label: The system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features.
background_label: This comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers.
method_label: For a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy.
method_label: For a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information.
method_label: Second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from Pros and Cons in a particular type of reviews.
method_label: Such features form the basis for the above comparison.
result_label: Experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly.

TITLE: Seeing Things from a Different Angle: Discovering Diverse Perspectives about Claims
ABSTRACT: background_label: One key consequence of the information revolution is a significant increase and a contamination of our information supply.
background_label: The practice of fact checking won't suffice to eliminate the biases in text data we observe, as the degree of factuality alone does not determine whether biases exist in the spectrum of opinions visible to us.
background_label: To better understand controversial issues, one needs to view them from a diverse yet comprehensive set of perspectives.
background_label: For example, there are many ways to respond to a claim such as"animals should have lawful rights", and these responses form a spectrum of perspectives, each with a stance relative to this claim and, ideally, with evidence supporting it.
objective_label: Inherently, this is a natural language understanding task, and we propose to address it as such.
result_label: Specifically, we propose the task of substantiated perspective discovery where, given a claim, a system is expected to discover a diverse set of well-corroborated perspectives that take a stance with respect to the claim.
background_label: Each perspective should be substantiated by evidence paragraphs which summarize pertinent results and facts.
method_label: We construct PERSPECTRUM, a dataset of claims, perspectives and evidence, making use of online debate websites to create the initial data collection, and augmenting it using search engines in order to expand and diversify our dataset.
method_label: We use crowd-sourcing to filter out noise and ensure high-quality data.
method_label: Our dataset contains 1k claims, accompanied with pools of 10k and 8k perspective sentences and evidence paragraphs, respectively.
result_label: We provide a thorough analysis of the dataset to highlight key underlying language understanding challenges, and show that human baselines across multiple subtasks far outperform ma-chine baselines built upon state-of-the-art NLP techniques.
result_label: This poses a challenge and opportunity for the NLP community to address.

TITLE: Aligning Books and Movies: Towards Story-like Visual Explanations by Watching Movies and Reading Books
ABSTRACT: background_label: Books are a rich source of both fine-grained information, how a character, an object or a scene looks like, as well as high-level semantics, what someone is thinking, feeling and how these states evolve through a story.
objective_label: This paper aims to align books to their movie releases in order to provide rich descriptive explanations for visual content that go semantically far beyond the captions available in current datasets.
method_label: To align movies and books we exploit a neural sentence embedding that is trained in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of books, as well as a video-text neural embedding for computing similarities between movie clips and sentences in the book.
method_label: We propose a context-aware CNN to combine information from multiple sources.
result_label: We demonstrate good quantitative performance for movie/book alignment and show several qualitative examples that showcase the diversity of tasks our model can be used for.

TITLE: Automatic Idiom Identification in Wiktionary
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractOnline resources, such as Wiktionary, provide an accurate but incomplete source of idiomatic phrases.
objective_label: In this paper, we study the problem of automatically identifying idiomatic dictionary entries with such resources.
method_label: We train an idiom classifier on a newly gathered corpus of over 60,000 Wiktionary multi-word definitions, incorporating features that model whether phrase meanings are constructed compositionally.
method_label: Experiments demonstrate that the learned classifier can provide high quality idiom labels, more than doubling the number of idiomatic entries from 7,764 to 18,155 at precision levels of over 65%.
result_label: These gains also translate to idiom detection in sentences, by simply using known word sense disambiguation algorithms to match phrases to their definitions.
result_label: In a set of Wiktionary definition example sentences, the more complete set of idioms boosts detection recall by over 28 percentage points.

TITLE: Support Vector Learning for Semantic Argument Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: The natural language processing community has recently experienced a growth of interest in domain independent shallow semantic parsing—the process of assigning a Who did What to Whom, When, Where, Why, How etc.
background_label: structure to plain text.
method_label: This process entails identifying groups of words in a sentence that represent these semantic arguments and assigning specific labels to them.
background_label: It could play a key role in NLP tasks like Information Extraction, Question Answering and Summarization.
method_label: We propose a machine learning algorithm for semantic role parsing, extending the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Surdeanu et al.
method_label: (2003) and others.
background_label: Our algorithm is based on Support Vector Machines which we show give large improvement in performance over earlier classifiers.
background_label: We show performance improvements through a number of new features designed to improve generalization to unseen data, such as automatic clustering of verbs.
background_label: We also report on various analytic studies examining which features are most important, comparing our classifier to other machine learning algorithms in the literature, and testing its generalization to new test set from different genre.
method_label: On the task of assigning semantic labels to the PropBank (Kingsbury, Palmer, & Marcus, 2002) corpus, our final system has a precision of 84% and a recall of 75%, which are the best results currently reported for this task.
method_label: Finally, we explore a completely different architecture which does not requires a deep syntactic parse.
result_label: We reformulate the task as a combined chunking and classification problem, thus allowing our algorithm to be applied to new languages or genres of text for which statistical syntactic parsers may not be available.

TITLE: Learning Gender-Neutral Word Embeddings
ABSTRACT: background_label: Word embedding models have become a fundamental component in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
background_label: However, embeddings trained on human-generated corpora have been demonstrated to inherit strong gender stereotypes that reflect social constructs.
objective_label: To address this concern, in this paper, we propose a novel training procedure for learning gender-neutral word embeddings.
objective_label: Our approach aims to preserve gender information in certain dimensions of word vectors while compelling other dimensions to be free of gender influence.
method_label: Based on the proposed method, we generate a Gender-Neutral variant of GloVe (GN-GloVe).
result_label: Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that GN-GloVe successfully isolates gender information without sacrificing the functionality of the embedding model.

TITLE: Analysis of Speeches in Indian Parliamentary Debates
ABSTRACT: background_label: With the increasing usage of the internet, more and more data is being digitized including parliamentary debates but they are in an unstructured format.
background_label: There is a need to convert them into a structured format for linguistic analysis.
background_label: Much work has been done on parliamentary data such as Hansard, American congressional floor-debate data on various aspects but less on pragmatics.
method_label: In this paper, we provide a dataset for the synopsis of Indian parliamentary debates and perform stance classification of speeches i.e identifying if the speaker is supporting the bill/issue or against it.
method_label: We also analyze the intention of the speeches beyond mere sentences i.e pragmatics in the parliament.
method_label: Based on thorough manual analysis of the debates, we developed an annotation scheme of 4 mutually exclusive categories to analyze the purpose of the speeches: to find out ISSUES, to BLAME, to APPRECIATE and for CALL FOR ACTION.
method_label: We have annotated the dataset provided, with these 4 categories and conducted preliminary experiments for automatic detection of the categories.
result_label: Our automated classification approach gave us promising results.

TITLE: Discursive Landscapes and Unsupervised Topic Modeling in IR: A Validation of Text-As-Data Approaches through a New Corpus of UN Security Council Speeches on Afghanistan
ABSTRACT: background_label: The recent turn towards quantitative text-as-data approaches in IR brought new ways to study the discursive landscape of world politics.
background_label: Here seen as complementary to qualitative approaches, quantitative assessments have the advantage of being able to order and make comprehensible vast amounts of text.
background_label: However, the validity of unsupervised methods applied to the types of text available in large quantities needs to be established before they can speak to other studies relying on text and discourse as data.
objective_label: In this paper, we introduce a new text corpus of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) speeches on Afghanistan between 2001 and 2017; we study this corpus through unsupervised topic modeling (LDA) with the central aim to validate the topic categories that the LDA identifies; and we discuss the added value, and complementarity, of quantitative text-as-data approaches.
method_label: We set-up two tests using mixed- method approaches.
method_label: Firstly, we evaluate the identified topics by assessing whether they conform with previous qualitative work on the development of the situation in Afghanistan.
method_label: Secondly, we use network analysis to study the underlying social structures of what we will call 'speaker-topic relations' to see whether they correspondent to know divisions and coalitions in the UNSC.
result_label: In both cases we find that the unsupervised LDA indeed provides valid and valuable outputs.
result_label: In addition, the mixed-method approaches themselves reveal interesting patterns deserving future qualitative research.
result_label: Amongst these are the coalition and dynamics around the 'women and human rights' topic as part of the UNSC debates on Afghanistan.

TITLE: When data permutations are pathological: the case of neural natural language inference
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractConsider two competitive machine learning models, one of which was considered state-of-the art, and the other a competitive baseline.
background_label: Suppose that by just permuting the examples of the training set, say by reversing the original order, by shuffling, or by mini-batching, you could report substantially better/worst performance for the system of your choice, by multiple percentage points.
objective_label: In this paper, we illustrate this scenario for a trending NLP task: Natural Language Inference (NLI).
method_label: We show that for the two central NLI corpora today, the learning process of neural systems is far too sensitive to permutations of the data.
result_label: In doing so we reopen the question of how to judge a good neural architecture for NLI, given the available dataset and perhaps, further, the soundness of the NLI task itself in its current state.

TITLE: ARGOS-Venice Boat Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Detection, classification, and tracking of people and vehicles are fundamental processes in intelligent surveillance systems.
background_label: The use of publicly available data set is the appropriate way to compare the relative merits of existing methods and to develop and assess new robust solutions.
method_label: In this paper, we focus on the maritime domain and we describe the generation of boat classification data sets, containing images of boats automatically extracted by the ARGOS system, operating 24/7 in Venice, Italy.
background_label: The data sets are unique in their nature, since they come from an incomparable environment like Venice, but they present very interesting challenges to vehicle classification, due to changes in the environmental conditions, boat wakes, waves, reflections, etc.
result_label: We thus believe that robust techniques, validated through the ARGOS Boat Classification data sets, will improve the development and deployment of solutions in similar applications related to vehicle detection and classification.

TITLE: Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: Inductive transfer learning has greatly impacted computer vision, but existing approaches in NLP still require task-specific modifications and training from scratch.
method_label: We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, and introduce techniques that are key for fine-tuning a language model.
method_label: Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24% on the majority of datasets.
method_label: Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100x more data.
result_label: We open-source our pretrained models and code.

TITLE: SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents the first shared task on irony detection: given a tweet, automatic natural language processing systems should determine whether the tweet is ironic (Task A) and which type of irony (if any) is expressed (Task B).
other_label: The ironic tweets were collected using irony-related hashtags (i.e.
method_label: #irony, #sarcasm, #not) and were subsequently manually annotated to minimise the amount of noise in the corpus.
method_label: Prior to distributing the data, hashtags that were used to collect the tweets were removed from the corpus.
method_label: For both tasks, a training corpus of 3,834 tweets was provided, as well as a test set containing 784 tweets.
result_label: Our shared tasks received submissions from 43 teams for the binary classification Task A and from 31 teams for the multiclass Task B.
result_label: The highest classification scores obtained for both subtasks are respectively F1= 0.71 and F1= 0.51 and demonstrate that fine-grained irony classification is much more challenging than binary irony detection.

TITLE: Tweet the debates: understanding community annotation of uncollected sources
ABSTRACT: background_label: We investigate the practice of sharing short messages (microblogging) around live media events.
objective_label: Our focus is on Twitter and its usage during the 2008 Presidential Debates.
background_label: We find that analysis of Twitter usage patterns around this media event can yield significant insights into the semantic structure and content of the media object.
method_label: Specifically, we find that the level of Twitter activity serves as a predictor of changes in topics in the media event.
result_label: Further we find that conversational cues can identify the key players in the media object and that the content of the Twitter posts can somewhat reflect the topics of discussion in the media object, but are mostly evaluative, in that they express the poster's reaction to the media.
objective_label: The key contribution of this work is an analysis of the practice of microblogging live events and the core metrics that can leveraged to evaluate and analyze this activity.
result_label: Finally, we offer suggestions on how our model of segmentation and node identification could apply towards any live, real-time arbitrary event.
