TITLE: Language Diversity across the Consonant Inventories: A Study in the Framework of Complex Networks
ABSTRACT: objective_label: n this paper, we attempt to explain the emergence of the linguistic diversity that exists across the consonant inventories of some of the major language families of the world through a complex network based growth model.
method_label: There is only a single parameter for this model that is meant to introduce a small amount of randomness in the otherwise preferential attachment based growth process.
method_label: The experiments with this model parameter indicates that the choice of consonants among the languages within a family are far more preferential than it is across the families.
result_label: The implications of this result are twofold -- (a) there is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain linguistic structures over others and (b) shared ancestry propels the stronger preferential connection between the languages within a family than across them.
result_label: Furthermore, our observations indicate that this parameter might bear a correlation with the period of existence of the language families under investigation.

TITLE: The myth of language universals: language diversity and its importance for cognitive science.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern.
background_label: In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them.
background_label: Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization.
background_label: This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective.
objective_label: This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages.
method_label: After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations.
result_label: Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition.
background_label: Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels.
result_label: Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.

TITLE: 2006. Analysis and Synthesis of the Distribution of Consonants over Languages: A Complex Network Approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-linguistic similarities are reflected by the speech sound systems of languages all over the world.
objective_label: In this work we try to model such similarities observed in the consonant inventories, through a complex bipartite network.
objective_label: We present a systematic study of some of the appealing features of these inventories with the help of the bipartite network.
method_label: An important observation is that the occurrence of consonants follows a two regime power law distribution.
result_label: We find that the consonant inventory size distribution together with the principle of preferential attachment are the main reasons behind the emergence of such a two regime behavior.
result_label: In order to further support our explanation we present a synthesis model for this network based on the general theory of preferential attachment.

TITLE: Adaptive Communication: Languages with More Non-Native Speakers Tend to Have Fewer Word Forms
ABSTRACT: background_label: Explaining the diversity of languages across the world is one of the central aims of typological, historical, and evolutionary linguistics.
background_label: We consider the effect of language contact-the number of non-native speakers a language has-on the way languages change and evolve.
method_label: By analysing hundreds of languages within and across language families, regions, and text types, we show that languages with greater levels of contact typically employ fewer word forms to encode the same information content (a property we refer to as lexical diversity).
result_label: Based on three types of statistical analyses, we demonstrate that this variance can in part be explained by the impact of non-native speakers on information encoding strategies.
result_label: Finally, we argue that languages are information encoding systems shaped by the varying needs of their speakers.
result_label: Language evolution and change should be modeled as the co-evolution of multiple intertwined adaptive systems: On one hand, the structure of human societies and human learning capabilities, and on the other, the structure of language.

TITLE: Patterns in the English Language: Phonological Networks, Percolation and Assembly Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper we provide a quantitative framework for the study of phonological networks (PNs) for the English language by carrying out principled comparisons to null models, either based on site percolation, randomization techniques, or network growth models.
background_label: In contrast to previous work, we mainly focus on null models that reproduce lower order characteristics of the empirical data.
method_label: We find that artificial networks matching connectivity properties of the English PN are exceedingly rare: this leads to the hypothesis that the word repertoire might have been assembled over time by preferentially introducing new words which are small modifications of old words.
method_label: Our null models are able to explain the"power-law-like"part of the degree distributions and generally retrieve qualitative features of the PN such as high clustering, high assortativity coefficient, and small-world characteristics.
result_label: However, the detailed comparison to expectations from null models also points out significant differences, suggesting the presence of additional constraints in word assembly.
result_label: Key constraints we identify are the avoidance of large degrees, the avoidance of triadic closure, and the avoidance of large non-percolating clusters.

TITLE: Syllable structure and sonority in language inventory and aphasic neologisms.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Phonological theories have raised the notion of a universally preferred syllable type which is defined in terms of its sonority structure (e.g., ).
background_label: Empirical evidence for this notion has been provided by distributional analyses of natural languages and of language acquisition data, and by aphasic speech error analyses.
objective_label: The present study investigates frequency distributions of syllable types in German, which allows for a rather complex syllable structure, and in neologistic utterances of a German speaking jargon aphasic.
result_label: The findings suggest that the sonority structure of the patient's neologisms is generally in accordance with the notion of theoretically preferred syllables.
result_label: Moreover, comparative analyses suggest that the predominance of the preferred syllable type is especially pronounced in the aphasic data.
result_label: On the basis of these findings, the influence of sonority in impaired phonological lexical processing is discussed.

TITLE: Discovering Global Patterns in Linguistic Networks through Spectral Analysis: A Case Study of the Consonant Inventories
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent research has shown that language and the socio-cognitive phenomena associated with it can be aptly modeled and visualized through networks of linguistic entities.
background_label: However, most of the existing works on linguistic networks focus only on the local properties of the networks.
objective_label: This study is an attempt to analyze the structure of languages via a purely structural technique, namely spectral analysis, which is ideally suited for discovering the global correlations in a network.
method_label: Application of this technique to PhoNet, the co-occurrence network of consonants, not only reveals several natural linguistic principles governing the structure of the consonant inventories, but is also able to quantify their relative importance.
result_label: We believe that this powerful technique can be successfully applied, in general, to study the structure of natural languages.

TITLE: Cultural route to the emergence of linguistic categories
ABSTRACT: background_label: Categories provide a coarse grained description of the world.
background_label: A fundamental question is whether categories simply mirror an underlying structure of nature, or instead come from the complex interactions of human beings among themselves and with the environment.
objective_label: Here we address this question by modelling a population of individuals who co-evolve their own system of symbols and meanings by playing elementary language games.
method_label: The central result is the emergence of a hierarchical category structure made of two distinct levels: a basic layer, responsible for fine discrimination of the environment, and a shared linguistic layer that groups together perceptions to guarantee communicative success.
result_label: Remarkably, the number of linguistic categories turns out to be finite and small, as observed in natural languages.

TITLE: The"handedness"of language: Directional symmetry breaking of sign usage in words
ABSTRACT: background_label: Language, which allows complex ideas to be communicated through symbolic sequences, is a characteristic feature of our species and manifested in a multitude of forms.
background_label: Using large written corpora for many different languages and scripts, we show that the occurrence probability distributions of signs at the left and right ends of words have a distinct heterogeneous nature.
background_label: Characterizing this asymmetry using quantitative inequality measures, viz.
method_label: information entropy and the Gini index, we show that the beginning of a word is less restrictive in sign usage than the end.
method_label: This property is not simply attributable to the use of common affixes as it is seen even when only word roots are considered.
method_label: We use the existence of this asymmetry to infer the direction of writing in undeciphered inscriptions that agrees with the archaeological evidence.
result_label: Unlike traditional investigations of phonotactic constraints which focus on language-specific patterns, our study reveals a property valid across languages and writing systems.
result_label: As both language and writing are unique aspects of our species, this universal signature may reflect an innate feature of the human cognitive phenomenon.

TITLE: The morphospace of language networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Language can be described as a network of interacting objects with different qualitative properties and complexity.
background_label: These networks include semantic, syntactic, or phonological levels and have been found to provide a new picture of language complexity and its evolution.
background_label: A general approach considers language from an information theory perspective that incorporates a speaker, a hearer, and a noisy channel.
background_label: The later is often encoded in a matrix connecting the signals used for communication with meanings to be found in the real world.
background_label: Most studies of language evolution deal in a way or another with such theoretical contraption and explore the outcome of diverse forms of selection on the communication matrix that somewhat optimizes communication.
method_label: This framework naturally introduces networks mediating the communicating agents, but no systematic analysis of the underlying landscape of possible language graphs has been developed.
method_label: Here we present a detailed analysis of network properties on a generic model of a communication code, which reveals a rather complex and heterogeneous morphospace of language networks.
method_label: Additionally, we use curated data of English words to locate and evaluate real languages within this language morphospace.
result_label: Our findings indicate a surprisingly simple structure in human language unless particles are introduced in the vocabulary, with the ability of naming any other concept.
result_label: These results refine and for the first time complement with empirical data a lasting theoretical tradition around the framework of \emph{least effort language}.

TITLE: Modeling the Structure and Dynamics of the Consonant Inventories: A Complex Network Approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: We study the self-organization of the consonant inventories through a complex network approach.
background_label: We observe that the distribution of occurrence as well as cooccurrence of the consonants across languages follow a power-law behavior.
background_label: The co-occurrence network of consonants exhibits a high clustering coefficient.
method_label: We propose four novel synthesis models for these networks (each of which is a refinement of the earlier) so as to successively match with higher accuracy (a) the above mentioned topological properties as well as (b) the linguistic property of feature economy exhibited by the consonant inventories.
method_label: We conclude by arguing that a possible interpretation of this mechanism of network growth is the process of child language acquisition.
result_label: Such models essentially increase our understanding of the structure of languages that is influenced by their evolutionary dynamics and this, in turn, can be extremely useful for building future NLP applications.

TITLE: Coupled dynamics of node and link states in complex networks: A model for language competition
ABSTRACT: background_label: Inspired by language competition processes, we present a model of coupled evolution of node and link states.
background_label: In particular, we focus on the interplay between the use of a language and the preference or attitude of the speakers towards it, which we model, respectively, as a property of the interactions between speakers (a link state) and as a property of the speakers themselves (a node state).
method_label: Furthermore, we restrict our attention to the case of two socially equivalent languages and to socially inspired network topologies based on a mechanism of triadic closure.
method_label: As opposed to most of the previous literature, where language extinction is an inevitable outcome of the dynamics, we find a broad range of possible asymptotic configurations, which we classify as: frozen extinction states, frozen coexistence states, and dynamically trapped coexistence states.
method_label: Moreover, metastable coexistence states with very long survival times and displaying a non-trivial dynamics are found to be abundant.
result_label: Interestingly, a system size scaling analysis shows, on the one hand, that the probability of language extinction vanishes exponentially for increasing system sizes and, on the other hand, that the time scale of survival of the non-trivial dynamical metastable states increases linearly with the size of the system.
result_label: Thus, non-trivial dynamical coexistence is the only possible outcome for large enough systems.
result_label: Finally, we show how this coexistence is characterized by one of the languages becoming clearly predominant while the other one becomes increasingly confined to"ghetto-like"structures: small groups of bilingual speakers arranged in triangles, with a strong preference for the minority language, and using it for their intra-group interactions while they switch to the predominant language for communications with the rest of the population.

TITLE: Characterizing the structural diversity of complex networks across domains
ABSTRACT: background_label: The structure of complex networks has been of interest in many scientific and engineering disciplines over the decades.
background_label: A number of studies in the field have been focused on finding the common properties among different kinds of networks such as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and modular structure and they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complex networks.
background_label: However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure across a diverse set of domains in order to explain the structural diversity we observe in the real-world networks.
method_label: In this paper, we study 986 real-world networks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online social networks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models.
method_label: Our study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random forest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among network domains in terms of network structure.
result_label: Our results indicate that there are some partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish based purely on network structure.
result_label: We have found that these partitions of network categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints and/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same partition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of engineering by human being, etc.
result_label: This suggests that the origin of a network, whether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be a decisive factor of the formation of similar network structure.
result_label: Our findings shed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hidden principles for the structural diversity of complex networks.

TITLE: Self-organization of the Sound Inventories: Analysis and Synthesis of the Occurrence and Co-occurrence Networks of Consonants
ABSTRACT: background_label: The sound inventories of the world's languages self-organize themselves giving rise to similar cross-linguistic patterns.
objective_label: In this work we attempt to capture this phenomenon of self-organization, which shapes the structure of the consonant inventories, through a complex network approach.
objective_label: For this purpose we define the occurrence and co-occurrence networks of consonants and systematically study some of their important topological properties.
method_label: A crucial observation is that the occurrence as well as the co-occurrence of consonants across languages follow a power law distribution.
method_label: This property is arguably a consequence of the principle of preferential attachment.
method_label: In order to support this argument we propose a synthesis model which reproduces the degree distribution for the networks to a close approximation.
method_label: We further observe that the co-occurrence network of consonants show a high degree of clustering and subsequently refine our synthesis model in order to incorporate this property.
result_label: Finally, we discuss how preferential attachment manifests itself through the evolutionary nature of language.

TITLE: Predicting language diversity with complex network
ABSTRACT: background_label: Evolution and propagation of the world's languages is a complex phenomenon, driven, to a large extent, by social interactions.
background_label: Multilingual society can be seen as a system of interacting agents, where the interaction leads to a modification of the language spoken by the individuals.
background_label: Two people can reach the state of full linguistic compatibility due to the positive interactions, like transfer of loanwords.
background_label: But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely different languages, they will separate from each other.
result_label: These simple observations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe and analyze dynamics of language change.
background_label: Although many mechanisms have been explained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for different sizes of a population.
objective_label: Here we address the issue of the language diversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions are crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data.
objective_label: We propose a model of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth of the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society.
method_label: We argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important characteristics of models properly describing empirical data.
method_label: Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case.
result_label: Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.

TITLE: Complex networks analysis of language complexity
ABSTRACT: background_label: Methods from statistical physics, such as those involving complex networks, have been increasingly used in quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena.
background_label: In this paper, we represented pieces of text with different levels of simplification in co-occurrence networks and found that topological regularity correlated negatively with textual complexity.
background_label: Furthermore, in less complex texts the distance between concepts, represented as nodes, tended to decrease.
method_label: The complex networks metrics were treated with multivariate pattern recognition techniques, which allowed us to distinguish between original texts and their simplified versions.
method_label: For each original text, two simplified versions were generated manually with increasing number of simplification operations.
method_label: As expected, distinction was easier for the strongly simplified versions, where the most relevant metrics were node strength, shortest paths and diversity.
result_label: Also, the discrimination of complex texts was improved with higher hierarchical network metrics, thus pointing to the usefulness of considering wider contexts around the concepts.
result_label: Though the accuracy rate in the distinction was not as high as in methods using deep linguistic knowledge, the complex network approach is still useful for a rapid screening of texts whenever assessing complexity is essential to guarantee accessibility to readers with limited reading ability

TITLE: Scale-free behavior of networks with the copresence of preferential and uniform attachment rules
ABSTRACT: background_label: Complex networks in different areas exhibit degree distributions with heavy upper tail.
background_label: A preferential attachment mechanism in a growth process produces a graph with this feature.
objective_label: We herein investigate a variant of the simple preferential attachment model, whose modifications are interesting for two main reasons: to analyze more realistic models and to study the robustness of the scale free behavior of the degree distribution.
method_label: We introduce and study a model which takes into account two different attachment rules: a preferential attachment mechanism (with probability 1-p) that stresses the rich get richer system, and a uniform choice (with probability p) for the most recent nodes.
result_label: The latter highlights a trend to select one of the last added nodes when no information is available.
background_label: The recent nodes can be either a given fixed number or a proportion (\alpha n) of the total number of existing nodes.
background_label: In the first case, we prove that this model exhibits an asymptotically power-law degree distribution.
method_label: The same result is then illustrated through simulations in the second case.
method_label: When the window of recent nodes has constant size, we herein prove that the presence of the uniform rule delays the starting time from which the asymptotic regime starts to hold.
method_label: The mean number of nodes of degree k and the asymptotic degree distribution are also determined analytically.
result_label: Finally, a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the model is performed.

TITLE: A Congruence Approach to the Syntax of Codeswitching
ABSTRACT: background_label: Hypotheses about the syntax of codeswitching thus far have for the most part not taken into account such factors as the nature of bilingualism in the community where the switching takes place, the relative status of the languages, the nature of bilingualism in the community and other aspects of the social context.
background_label: This paper argues that an adequate theory of codeswitching syntax is one where such factors are held to be relevant, so that the actual nature of the switching is relative not only to the language pairs, but also to other situational factors.
background_label: Previous researchers have used notions of “congruent” or “equivalent” categories, implicitly or explicitly, tending to treat these as universal categories of phrase structure and looking for “constraints” which limit the possible outcome of the interaction of two linguistic systems.
method_label: This paper argues that “congruence” of categories is construed or “created” by bilinguals in a given situation, with four alternative outcomes for a given candidate switch: harmonization, neutralization, compromise, and blocking.
result_label: Rather than seeing codeswitching utterances as the product of “constraints,” it develops a view where codeswitching is the result of languages aligning their structures over time to achieve congruence.

TITLE: Patterns of segmental modification in consonant inventories: a cross-linguistic study
ABSTRACT: background_label: It is well known that secondary articulation types, such as labialization and palatalization, as well as laryngeal modifications, such as aspiration and glottalization, can play a contrastive role in segment inventories.
objective_label: This article describes an investigation of such segmental modifications, whether laryngeal, supralaryngeal or nasal, on the basis of detailed analyses of each of the 317 languages in the cross-linguistic database presented in Maddieson (1984).
method_label: In the first part of this investigation, the hypothesis is tested that segmental modifications occur on natural classes of consonants rather than randomly or on isolated segments.
method_label: A formalism is proposed to express this regularity.
result_label: Recent theoretical proposals concerning the representation of complex segments, in particular affricates, lead to predictions regarding the patterning of segmental modification on such segments; in the second part of our investigation, these predictions are tested against the cross-linguistic data on segmental modification on affricates in the same sample of languages.

TITLE: Universal Entropy of Word Ordering Across Linguistic                     Families
ABSTRACT: background_label: BACKGROUND The language faculty is probably the most distinctive feature of our species, and endows us with a unique ability to exchange highly structured information.
background_label: In written language, information is encoded by the concatenation of basic symbols under grammatical and semantic constraints.
background_label: As is also the case in other natural information carriers, the resulting symbolic sequences show a delicate balance between order and disorder.
background_label: That balance is determined by the interplay between the diversity of symbols and by their specific ordering in the sequences.
method_label: Here we used entropy to quantify the contribution of different organizational levels to the overall statistical structure of language.
method_label: METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We computed a relative entropy measure to quantify the degree of ordering in word sequences from languages belonging to several linguistic families.
method_label: While a direct estimation of the overall entropy of language yielded values that varied for the different families considered, the relative entropy quantifying word ordering presented an almost constant value for all those families.
result_label: CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Our results indicate that despite the differences in the structure and vocabulary of the languages analyzed, the impact of word ordering in the structure of language is a statistical linguistic universal.

TITLE: Is space a word, too?
ABSTRACT: background_label: For words, rank-frequency distributions have long been heralded for adherence to a potentially-universal phenomenon known as Zipf's law.
background_label: The hypothetical form of this empirical phenomenon was refined by Ben\^{i}ot Mandelbrot to that which is presently referred to as the Zipf-Mandelbrot law.
background_label: Parallel to this, Herbet Simon proposed a selection model potentially explaining Zipf's law.
background_label: However, a significant dispute between Simon and Mandelbrot, notable empirical exceptions, and the lack of a strong empirical connection between Simon's model and the Zipf-Mandelbrot law have left the questions of universality and mechanistic generation open.
objective_label: We offer a resolution to these issues by exhibiting how the dark matter of word segmentation, i.e., space, punctuation, etc., connect the Zipf-Mandelbrot law to Simon's mechanistic process.
method_label: This explains Mandelbrot's refinement as no more than a fudge factor, accommodating the effects of the exclusion of the rank-frequency dark matter.
result_label: Thus, integrating these non-word objects resolves a more-generalized rank-frequency law.
result_label: Since this relies upon the integration of space, etc., we find support for the hypothesis that $all$ are generated by common processes, indicating from a physical perspective that space is a word, too.

TITLE: Diversity Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe introduce Divnet, a flexible technique for learning networks with diverse neurons.
background_label: Divnet models neuronal diversity by placing a Determinantal Point Process (DPP) over neurons in a given layer.
method_label: It uses this DPP to select a subset of diverse neurons and subsequently fuses the redundant neurons into the selected ones.
method_label: Compared with previous approaches, Divnet offers a more principled, flexible technique for capturing neuronal diversity and thus implicitly enforcing regularization.
method_label: This enables effective auto-tuning of network architecture and leads to smaller network sizes without hurting performance.
method_label: Moreover, through its focus on diversity and neuron fusing, Divnet remains compatible with other procedures that seek to reduce memory footprints of networks.
result_label: We present experimental results to corroborate our claims: for pruning neural networks, Divnet is seen to be notably superior to competing approaches.

TITLE: Natural Models for Evolution on Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous populations, mainly described my the Moran process.
background_label: Recently, this approach has been generalized in \cite{LHN} by arranging individuals on the nodes of a network.
background_label: Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than directed ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers of selection.
method_label: In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs which act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that is at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices increases.
result_label: Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the fixation probability of general undirected graphs.
background_label: As our main contribution, we introduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in \cite{LHN}, where all individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between aggressive and non-aggressive individuals.
background_label: That is, the behavior of the individuals in our new model and in the model of \cite{LHN} can be interpreted as an"aggregation"vs. an"all-or-nothing"strategy, respectively.
method_label: We prove that our new model of mutual influences admits a \emph{potential function}, which guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any initial fitness vector of the individuals.
method_label: Furthermore, we prove fast convergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as we provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals.
result_label: Apart from being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be useful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading populations in networks.
result_label: We demonstrate this by introducing and analyzing two alternative control approaches, for which we bound the time needed to stabilize to the"healthy"state of the system.

TITLE: The Greenbergian word order correlations
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper reports on the results of a detailed empirical study of word order correlations, based on a sample of 625 languages.
background_label: The primary result is a determination of exactly what pairs of elements correlate in order with the verb and object.
background_label: Some pairs of elements that have been claimed to correlate in order with the verb and object do not in fact exhibit any correlation.
method_label: I argue against the Head-Dependent Theory (HDT), according to which the correlations reflect a tendency towards consistent ordering of heads and dependents.
method_label: I offer an alternative account, the Branching Direction Theory (BDT), based on consistent ordering of phrasal and nonphrasal elements.
result_label: According to the BDT, the word order correlations reflect a tendency for languages to be consistently right-branching or consistently left-branching.

TITLE: Language and spatial cognition : an interdisciplinary study of the prepositions in English
ABSTRACT: background_label: This book provides a precise and thorough description of the meaning and use of spatial expressions, using both a linguistics and an artificial intelligence perspective, and also an enlightening discussion of computer models of comprehension and production in the spatial domain.
objective_label: The author proposes a theoretical framework that explains many previously overlooked or misunderstood irregularities.
method_label: The use of prepositions reveals underlying schematisations and idealisations of the spatial world, which, for the most part, echo representational structures necessary for human action (movement and manipulation).
result_label: Because spatial cognition seems to provide a key to understanding much of the cognitive system, including language, the book addresses one of the most basic questions confronting cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and brings fresh and original insights to it.

TITLE: Family Honor and the Forces of Change in Arab Society
ABSTRACT: background_label: Although every study of Arab society agrees on the central importance of the family to the organization of society, there has been relatively little discussion of the honor of the family, 'ird.
background_label: In the descriptions that exist, this honor is characterized as preoccupation with sexual purity and chastity, or as a cause of suspicion and jealousy between men and women.2 The distinctive characteristics of honor have never been spelled out; it is usually referred to briefly and then discarded in favor of such topics as the authority structure, the preference for marriage with the father's brother's daughter, and the seclusion of women.
background_label: Yet much of the organization of the Arab family can be understood in terms of 'ird as a controlling value, legitimating the family structure and the 'modesty code' required of both men and women.
background_label: While 'ird is most evident in the tribal and peasant sectors of society, it also appears in the contemporary urban sector, in all but the most 'modernized' families.
background_label: Although such forces of change as urbanization, social revolution, and education may have an impact on the value of 'ird and its associated norms, this value and these norms resist the processes of change.
result_label: Such is the argument of this study.
other_label: The only comprehensive study of family honor among the Arabs is a historical one, concentrating on the pre-Islamic period.3 Summarizing this research, the author states:

TITLE: Evolution of cooperation in a finite homogeneous graph
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent theoretical studies of selection in finite structured populations have worked with one of two measures of selective advantage of an allele: fixation probability and inclusive fitness.
background_label: Each approach has its own analytical strengths, but given certain assumptions they provide equivalent results.
background_label: In most instances the structure of the population can be specified by a network of nodes connected by edges (that is, a graph), and much of the work here has focused on a continuous-time model of evolution, first described by ref.
background_label: 11.
method_label: Working in this context, we provide an inclusive fitness analysis to derive a surprisingly simple analytical condition for the selective advantage of a cooperative allele in any graph for which the structure satisfies a general symmetry condition (‘bi-transitivity’).
result_label: Our results hold for a broad class of population structures, including most of those analysed previously, as well as some for which a direct calculation of fixation probability has appeared intractable.
result_label: Notably, under some forms of population regulation, the ability of a cooperative allele to invade is seen to be independent of the nature of population structure (and in particular of how game partnerships are specified) and is identical to that for an unstructured population.
result_label: For other types of population regulation our results reveal that cooperation can invade if players choose partners along relatively ‘high-weight’ edges.

method_label: Together with presenting the problems arising in the course of the implementation of such systems, their usage patterns are also investigated.

TITLE: Similar but Different: Dynamic Social Network Analysis Highlights Fundamental Differences between the Fission-Fusion Societies of Two Equid Species, the Onager and Grevy’s Zebra
ABSTRACT: background_label: Understanding why animal societies take on the form that they do has benefited from insights gained by applying social network analysis to patterns of individual associations.
background_label: Such analyses typically aggregate data over long time periods even though most selective forces that shape sociality have strong temporal elements.
method_label: By explicitly incorporating the temporal signal in social interaction data we re-examine the network dynamics of the social systems of the evolutionarily closely-related Grevy's zebras and wild asses that show broadly similar social organizations.
method_label: By identifying dynamic communities, previously hidden differences emerge: Grevy's zebras show more modularity than wild asses and in wild asses most communities consist of solitary individuals; and in Grevy's zebras, lactating females show a greater propensity to switch communities than non-lactating females and males.
result_label: Both patterns were missed by static network analyses and in general, adding a temporal dimension provides insights into differences associated with the size and persistence of communities as well as the frequency and synchrony of their formation.
result_label: Dynamic network analysis provides insights into the functional significance of these social differences and highlights the way dynamic community analysis can be applied to other species.

TITLE: The design and validation of a spatial microsimulation model of obesogenic environments for children in Leeds, UK: SimObesity.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Obesogenic environments are a major explanation for the rapidly increasing prevalence in obesity.
background_label: Investigating the relationship between obesity and obesogenic variables at the micro-level will increase our understanding about local differences in risk factors for obesity.
objective_label: SimObesity is a spatial microsimulation model designed to create micro-level estimates of obesogenic environment variables in the city of Leeds in the UK: consisting of a plethora of health, environment, and socio-economic variables.
method_label: It combines individual micro-data from two national surveys with a coarse geography, with geographically finer scaled data from the 2001 UK Census, using a reweighting deterministic algorithm.
method_label: This creates a synthetic population of individuals/households in Leeds with attributes from both the survey and census datasets.
result_label: Logistic regression analyses identify suitable constraint variables to use.
result_label: The model is validated using linear regression and equal variance t-tests.
background_label: Height, weight, age, gender, and residential postcode data were collected on children aged 3-13 years in the Leeds metropolitan area, and obesity described as above the 98th centile for the British reference dataset.
method_label: Geographically weighted regression is used to investigate the relationship between different obesogenic environments and childhood obesity.
method_label: Validation shows that the small-area estimates were robust.
method_label: The different obesogenic environments, as well as the parameter estimates from the corresponding local regression analyses, are mapped, all of which demonstrate non-stationary relationships.
result_label: These results show that social capital and poverty are strongly associated with childhood obesity.
result_label: This paper demonstrates a methodology to estimate health variables at the small-area level.
method_label: The key to this technique is the choice of the model's input variables, which must be predictors for the output variables; this factor has not been stressed in other spatial microsimulation work.
result_label: It also provides further evidence for the existence of obesogenic environments for children.

TITLE: A Microphotonic Astrocomb
ABSTRACT: background_label: One of the essential prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers.
background_label: It has already been realized that the large number of exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as calibration light sources.
background_label: A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers.
method_label: Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23.7 GHz.
method_label: This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer.
result_label: As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research.

TITLE: Measuring preferential attachment in growing networks with missing-timelines using Markov chain Monte Carlo
ABSTRACT: background_label: Preferential attachment is widely recognised as the principal driving force behind the evolution of many growing networks, and measuring the extent to which it occurs during the growth of a network is important for explaining its overall structure.
background_label: Conventional methods require that the timeline of a growing network is known, that is, the order in which the nodes of the network appeared in time is available.
background_label: But growing network datasets are commonly accompanied by missing-timelines, in which instance the order of the nodes in time cannot be readily ascertained from the data.
method_label: To address this shortcoming, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for measuring preferential attachment in growing networks with missing-timelines.
method_label: Key to our approach is that any growing network model gives rise to a probability distribution over the space of networks.
method_label: This enables a growing network model to be fitted to a growing network dataset with missing-timeline, allowing not only for the prevalence of preferential attachment to be estimated as a model parameter, but the timeline also.
method_label: Parameter estimation is achieved by implementing a novel Metropolis–Hastings sampling scheme for updating both the preferential attachment parameter and timeline.
result_label: A simulation study demonstrates that our method accurately measures the occurrence of preferential attachment in networks generated according to the underlying model.
result_label: What is more, our approach is illustrated on a small sub-network of the United States patent citation network.
result_label: Since the timeline for this example is in fact known, we are able to validate our approach against the conventional methods, showing that they give mutually consistent estimates.

TITLE: Global topology of word co-occurrence networks: Beyond the two-regime power-law
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWord co-occurrence networks are one of the most common linguistic networks studied in the past and they are known to exhibit several interesting topological characteristics.
objective_label: In this article, we investigate the global topological properties of word co-occurrence networks and, in particular, present a detailed study of their spectrum.
method_label: Our experiments reveal certain universal trends found across the networks for seven different languages from three different language families, which are neither reported nor explained by any of the previous studies and models of word-cooccurrence networks.
method_label: We hypothesize that since word co-occurrences are governed by syntactic properties of a language, the network has much constrained topology than that predicted by the previously proposed growth model.
result_label: A deeper empirical and theoretical investigation into the evolution of these networks further suggests that they have a coreperiphery structure, where the core hardly evolves with time and new words are only attached to the periphery of the network.
result_label: These properties are fundamental to the nature of word co-occurrence across languages.

TITLE: Population size predicts lexical diversity, but so does the mean sea level - one problem in the analysis of temporal data
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe document an apparently spectacular relationship between population size and lexical diversity: for five out of seven investigated languages, there is a strong relationship between population size and lexical diversity of the primary language in this country.We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model that does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar but nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and lexical diversity.
method_label: Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were published that seem to suffer from this problem [12-18], we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has profound consequences.
method_label: We demonstrate how simple transformation of the time series can often solve problems of this type and argue that the evaluation of the plausibility of a relationship is important in this context.
result_label: Following [19] , we hope that our paper will help both researchers and reviewers to understand why it is important to use special models for the analysis of data with a natural temporal ordering.

TITLE: How people make friends in social networking sites - A microscopic perspective
ABSTRACT: background_label: We study the detailed growth of a social networking site with full temporal information by examining the creation process of each friendship relation that can collectively lead to the macroscopic properties of the network.
background_label: We first study the reciprocal behavior of users, and find that link requests are quickly responded to and that the distribution of reciprocation intervals decays in an exponential form.
method_label: The degrees of inviters/accepters are slightly negatively correlative with reciprocation time.
method_label: In addition, the temporal feature of the online community shows that the distributions of intervals of user behaviors, such as sending or accepting link requests, follow a power law with a universal exponent, and peaks emerge for intervals of an integral day.
method_label: We finally study the preferential selection and linking phenomena of the social networking site and find that, for the former, a linear preference holds for preferential sending and reception, and for the latter, a linear preference also holds for preferential acceptance, creation, and attachment.
method_label: Based on the linearly preferential linking, we put forward an analyzable network model which can reproduce the degree distribution of the network.
result_label: The research framework presented in the paper could provide a potential insight into how the micro-motives of users lead to the global structure of online social networks.

TITLE: Analysis of diverse regulatory networks in a hierarchical context shows consistent tendencies for collaboration in the middle levels.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Gene regulatory networks have been shown to share some common aspects with commonplace social governance structures.
background_label: Thus, we can get some intuition into their organization by arranging them into well-known hierarchical layouts.
background_label: These hierarchies, in turn, can be placed between the extremes of autocracies, with well-defined levels and clear chains of command, and democracies, without such defined levels and with more co-regulatory partnerships between regulators.
background_label: In general, the presence of partnerships decreases the variation in information flow amongst nodes within a level, more evenly distributing stress.
method_label: Here we study various regulatory networks (transcriptional, modification, and phosphorylation) for five diverse species, Escherichia coli to human.
method_label: We specify three levels of regulators--top, middle, and bottom--which collectively govern the non-regulator targets lying in the lowest fourth level.
method_label: We define quantities for nodes, levels, and entire networks that measure their degree of collaboration and autocratic vs. democratic character.
result_label: We show individual regulators have a range of partnership tendencies: Some regulate their targets in combination with other regulators in local instantiations of democratic structure, whereas others regulate mostly in isolation, in more autocratic fashion.
result_label: Overall, we show that in all networks studied the middle level has the highest collaborative propensity and coregulatory partnerships occur most frequently amongst midlevel regulators, an observation that has parallels in corporate settings where middle managers must interact most to ensure organizational effectiveness.
result_label: There is, however, one notable difference between networks in different species: The amount of collaborative regulation and democratic character increases markedly with overall genomic complexity.

TITLE: A self-consistent approach to measure preferential attachment in networks and its application to an inherent structure network
ABSTRACT: background_label: Preferential attachment is one possible way to obtain a scale-free network.
method_label: We develop a self-consistent method to determine whether preferential attachment occurs during the growth of a network, and to extract the preferential attachment rule using time-dependent data.
method_label: Model networks are grown with known preferential attachment rules to test the method, which is seen to be robust.
method_label: The method is then applied to a scale-free inherent structure network, which represents the connections between minima via transition states on a potential energy landscape.
result_label: Even though this network is static, we can examine the growth of the network as a function of a threshold energy (rather than time), where only those transition states with energies lower than the threshold energy contribute to the network.For these networks we are able to detect the presence of preferential attachment, and this helps to explain the ubiquity of funnels on energy landscapes.
result_label: However, the scale-free degree distribution shows some differences from that of a model network grown using the obtained preferential attachment rules, implying that other factors are also important in the growth process.

TITLE: A modelling and computational study of the frustration index in signed networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Computing the frustration index of a signed graph is a key step toward solving problems in many fields including social networks, political science, physics, chemistry, and biology.
background_label: The frustration index determines the distance of a network from a state of total structural balance.
background_label: Although the definition of the frustration index goes back to the 1950's, its exact algorithmic computation, which is closely related to classic NP-hard graph problems, has only become a focus in recent years.
method_label: We develop three new binary linear programming models to compute the frustration index exactly and efficiently as the solution to a global optimisation problem.
method_label: Solving the models with prioritised branching and valid inequalities in Gurobi, we can compute the frustration index of real signed networks with over 15000 edges in less than a minute on inexpensive hardware.
result_label: We provide extensive performance analysis for both random and real signed networks and show that our models outperform all existing approaches by large factors.
result_label: Based on solve time, algorithm output, and effective branching factor we highlight the superiority of our models to both exact and heuristic methods in the literature.

TITLE: The English Resultative as a Family of Constructions
ABSTRACT: background_label: English resultative expressions have been a major focus of research on the syntax-semantics interface.
background_label: We argue in this article that a family of related constructions is required to account for their distribution.
method_label: We demonstrate that a number of generalizations follow from the semantics of the constructions we posit: the syntactic argument structure of the sentence is predicted by general principles of argument linking; and the aspectual structure of the sentence is determined by the aspectual structure of the constructional subevent, which is in turn predictable from general principles correlating event structure with change, extension, motion, and paths.
method_label: Finally, the semantics and syntax of resultatives explain the possibilities for temporal relations between the two subevents.
background_label: While these generalizations clearly exist, there is also a great deal of idiosyncrasy involved in resultatives.
background_label: Many idiosyncratic instances and small subclasses of the construction must be learned and stored individually.
objective_label: This account serves to justify aspects of what we share in our overall vision of grammar, whatwe might call the CONSTRUCTIONAL view.
result_label: To the extent that our treatment of the resultative can be stated only within the constructional view, it serves as evidence for this view as a whole.

TITLE: Crater functions for compound materials: a route to parameter estimation in coupled-PDE models of ion bombardment
ABSTRACT: background_label: During the ion bombardment of targets containing multiple component species, highly-ordered arrays of nanostructures are sometimes observed.
background_label: Models incorporating coupled partial differential equations, describing both morphological and chemical evolution, seem to offer the most promise of explaining these observations.
background_label: However, these models contain many unknown parameters, which must satisfy specific conditions in order to explain observed behavior.
background_label: The lack of knowledge of these parameters is therefore an important barrier to the comparison of theory with experiment.
method_label: Here, by adapting the recent theory of"crater functions"to the case of binary materials, we develop a generic framework in which many of the parameters of such models can be estimated using the results of molecular dynamics simulations.
method_label: As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the recent theory of Bradley and Shipman, for the case of Ar-irradiated GaSb, in which ordered patterns were first observed.
result_label: In contrast to the requirements therein that sputtered atoms form the dominant component of the collision cascade, and that preferential redistribution play an important stabilizing role, we find instead that the redistributed atoms dominate the collision cascade, and that preferential redistribution appears negligible.
result_label: Hence, the actual estimated parameters for this system do not seem to satisfy the requirements imposed by current theory, motivating the consideration of other potential pattern-forming mechanisms.

TITLE: Monetizing Network Hospitality: Hospitality and Sociability in the Context of Airbnb
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a qualitative study of hospitality exchange processes that take place via the online peer-to-peer platform Airbnb.
objective_label: We explore 1) what motivates individuals to monetize network hospitality and 2) how the presence of money ties in with the social interaction related to network hospitality.
method_label: We approach the topic from the perspective of hosts -- that is, Airbnb users who participate by offering accommodation for other members in exchange for monetary compensation.
method_label: We found that participants were motivated to monetize network hospitality for both financial and social reasons.
result_label: Our analysis indicates that the presence of money can provide a helpful frame for network hospitality, supporting hosts in their efforts to accomplish desired sociability, select guests consistent with their preferences, and control the volume and type of demand.
result_label: We conclude the paper with a critical discussion of the implications of our findings for network hospitality and, more broadly, for the so-called sharing economy.

TITLE: Sonority and Climate in a World Sample of Languages: Findings and Prospects
ABSTRACT: background_label: In a world sample (N = 60), the indigenous languages of tropical and subtropical climates in contrast to the languages spoken in temperate and cold zones manifested high levels of sonority.
background_label: High sonority in phonetic segments, as found for example in vowels (versus consonants), increases the carrying power of speech sounds and, hence, audibility at a distance.
background_label: We assume that in the course of daily activities, the speakers in warm/hot climates (a) are often outdoors due to equable ambient temperatures, (b) thereby frequently transmit messages distally, and (c) transmit such messages relatively intelligibly due to the acoustic and functional advantages of high sonority.
method_label: Our conceptual model is similar to that of population biology, where there are well-known correlations between climate and somatic variables, and where it is assumed that communicative modalities and behaviors are selected or designed for success in specific habitats.
result_label: We also take up possible alternative hypotheses and consider directions for...

ABSTRACT: background_label: We investigate the nature of written human language within the framework of complex network theory.
method_label: In particular, we analyse the topology of Orwell's \textit{1984} focusing on the local properties of the network, such as the properties of the nearest neighbors and the clustering coefficient.
method_label: We find a composite power law behavior for both the average nearest neighbor's degree and average clustering coefficient as a function of the vertex degree.
method_label: This implies the existence of different functional classes of vertices.
method_label: Furthermore we find that the second order vertex correlations are an essential component of the network architecture.
method_label: To model our empirical results we extend a previously introduced model for language due to Dorogovtsev and Mendes.
method_label: We propose an accelerated growing network model that contains three growth mechanisms: linear preferential attachment, local preferential attachment and the random growth of a pre-determined small finite subset of initial vertices.
result_label: We find that with these elementary stochastic rules we are able to produce a network showing syntactic-like structures.

TITLE: A bibliometric approach to Systematic Mapping Studies: The case of the evolution and perspectives of community detection in complex networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Critical analysis of the state of the art is a necessary task when identifying new research lines worthwhile to pursue.
background_label: To such an end, all the available work related to the field of interest must be taken into account.
background_label: The key point is how to organize, analyze, and make sense of the huge amount of scientific literature available today on any topic.
objective_label: To tackle this problem, we present here a bibliometric approach to Systematic Mapping Studies (SMS).
method_label: Thus, a modify SMS protocol is used relying on the scientific references metadata to extract, process and interpret the wealth of information contained in nowadays research literature.
method_label: As a test case, the procedure is applied to determine the current state and perspectives of community detection in complex networks.
result_label: Our results show that community detection is a still active, far from exhausted, in development, field.
result_label: In addition, we find that, by far, the most exploited methods are those related to determining hierarchical community structures.
result_label: On the other hand, the results show that fuzzy clustering techniques, despite their interest, are underdeveloped as well as the adaptation of existing algorithms to parallel or, more specifically, distributed, computational systems.

TITLE: The Many Faces of Empathy: Parsing Empathic Phenomena through a Proximate, Dynamic-Systems View of Representing the Other in the Self:
ABSTRACT: background_label: A surfeit of research confirms that people activate personal, affective, and conceptual representations when perceiving the states of others.
background_label: However, researchers continue to debate the role of self–other overlap in empathy due to a failure to dissociate neural overlap, subjective resonance, and personal distress.
background_label: A perception–action view posits that neural-level overlap is necessary during early processing for all social understanding, but need not be conscious or aversive.
objective_label: This neural overlap can subsequently produce a variety of states depending on the context and degree of common experience and emotionality.
method_label: We outline a framework for understanding the interrelationship between neural and subjective overlap, and among empathic states, through a dynamic-systems view of how information is processed in the brain and body.

TITLE: Mechanisms of complex network growth: Synthesis of the preferential attachment and fitness models.
ABSTRACT: background_label: We analyze growth mechanisms of complex networks and focus on their validation by measurements.
method_label: To this end we consider the equation ΔK=A(t)(K+K_{0})Δt, where K is the node's degree, ΔK is its increment, A(t) is the aging constant, and K_{0} is the initial attractivity.
method_label: This equation has been commonly used to validate the preferential attachment mechanism.
other_label: We show that this equation is undiscriminating and holds for the fitness model [Caldarelli et al., Phys.
other_label: Rev.
other_label: Lett.
background_label: 89, 258702 (2002)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.89.258702] as well.
background_label: In other words, accepted method of the validation of the microscopic mechanism of network growth does not discriminate between "rich-gets-richer" and "good-gets-richer" scenarios.
background_label: This means that the growth mechanism of many natural complex networks can be based on the fitness model rather than on the preferential attachment, as it was believed so far.
method_label: The fitness model yields the long-sought explanation for the initial attractivity K_{0}, an elusive parameter which was left unexplained within the framework of the preferential attachment model.
method_label: We show that the initial attractivity is determined by the width of the fitness distribution.
result_label: We also present the network growth model based on recursive search with memory and show that this model contains both the preferential attachment and the fitness models as extreme cases.

TITLE: Network analysis reveals structure indicative of syntax in the corpus of undeciphered Indus civilization inscriptions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Archaeological excavations in the sites of the Indus Valley civilization (2500-1900 BCE) in Pakistan and northwestern India have unearthed a large number of artifacts with inscriptions made up of hundreds of distinct signs.
background_label: To date, there is no generally accepted decipherment of these sign sequences, and there have been suggestions that the signs could be non-linguistic.
method_label: Here we apply complex network analysis techniques on the data-base of available Indus inscriptions, with the aim of detecting patterns indicative of syntactic structure in this sign system.
result_label: Our results show the presence of regularities, e.g., in the segmentation trees of the sequences, that suggest the existence of a grammar underlying the construction of the sequences.

TITLE: Degree Distribution of Competition-Induced Preferential Attachment Graphs
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce a family of one-dimensional geometric growth models, constructed iteratively by locally optimizing the tradeoffs between two competing metrics, and show that this family is equivalent to a family of preferential attachment random graph models with upper cutoffs.
objective_label: This is the first explanation of how preferential attachment can arise from a more basic underlying mechanism of local competition.
method_label: We rigorously determine the degree distribution for the family of random graph models, showing that it obeys a power law up to a finite threshold and decays exponentially above this threshold.
method_label: We also rigorously analyze a generalized version of our graph process, with two natural parameters, one corresponding to the cutoff and the other a ``fertility'' parameter.
method_label: We prove that the general model has a power-law degree distribution up to a cutoff, and establish monotonicity of the power as a function of the two parameters.
result_label: Limiting cases of the general model include the standard preferential attachment model without cutoff and the uniform attachment model.

TITLE: Semantic maps and the typology of colexification: intertwining polysemous networks across languages
ABSTRACT: background_label: Building upon the model of Semantic Maps (Haspelmath 2003), which typologists have designed mainly for grammatical semantics, this chapter discusses methodological issues for a model in lexical typology.
background_label: By breaking up polysemous lexemes of various languages into their semantic ‘atoms' or senses, one defines an etic grid against which cross-linguistic comparison can be undertaken.
background_label: Languages differ as to which senses they colexify, i.e., lexify identically.
method_label: But while each polysemous lexeme as a whole is language-specific, individual pairings of colexified senses can be compared across languages.
result_label: Our model, understood as an empirical, atomistic approach to lexical typology, is finally exemplified with the rich polysemies associated with the notion “BREATHE”.
result_label: Intertwined together, they compose a single, universal network of potential semantic extensions.

TITLE: PAFit: an R Package for Estimating Preferential Attachment and Node Fitness in Temporal Complex Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many real-world systems are profitably described as complex networks that grow over time.
background_label: Preferential attachment and node fitness are two ubiquitous growth mechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications in modeling and inference.
background_label: In the node fitness mechanism, the probability a node acquires a new edge is proportional to a quantity called fitness that is assumed to be independent of the network structure.
background_label: On the other hand, in the preferential attachment mechanism, this probability of acquiring new edges is proportional to a function of the current number of edges of the node.
background_label: While this function is originally assumed to be the linear function, and hence fixed, in general it can be arbitrary, and thus is the target of estimation in real-world datasets.
background_label: While there are standard statistical packages for estimating the structural properties of complex networks, there is no corresponding package when it comes to the estimation of preferential attachment and node fitness mechanisms.
method_label: This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements well-established statistical methods for estimating preferential attachment and node fitness, as well as a number of functions for generating complex networks from these two mechanisms.
method_label: The main computational part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure good performance for large-scale networks.
result_label: In this paper, we first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit using simulated examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration network between scientists in the field of complex networks.

TITLE: The emergence of linguistic structure: an overview of the iterated learning model
ABSTRACT: background_label: As language users humans possess a culturally transmitted system of unparalleled complexity in the natural world.
background_label: Linguistics has revealed over the past 40 years the degree to which the syntactic structure of language in particular is strikingly complex.
background_label: Furthermore, as Pinker and Bloom point out in their agenda-setting paper Natural Language and Natural Selection “grammar is a complex mechanism tailored to the transmission of propositional structures through a serial interface” (Pinker and Bloom, 1990: 707).
result_label: These sorts of observations, along with influential arguments from linguistics and psychology about the innateness of language (see Chomsky, 1986; Pinker, 1994), have led many authors to the conclusion that an explanation for the origin of syntax must invoke neo-Darwinian natural selection.

TITLE: Multiplex lexical networks reveal patterns in early word acquisition in children
ABSTRACT: background_label: Network models of language have provided a way of linking cognitive processes to the structure and connectivity of language.
background_label: However, one shortcoming of current approaches is focusing on only one type of linguistic relationship at a time, missing the complex multi-relational nature of language.
objective_label: In this work, we overcome this limitation by modelling the mental lexicon of English-speaking toddlers as a multiplex lexical network, i.e.
method_label: a multi-layered network where N=529 words/nodes are connected according to four types of relationships: (i) free associations, (ii) feature sharing, (iii) co-occurrence, and (iv) phonological similarity.
method_label: We provide analysis of the topology of the resulting multiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers as well as the full multiplex structure on their ability to predict empirically observed age of acquisition data of English speaking toddlers.
result_label: We find that the emerging multiplex network topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of acquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure.
result_label: In fact, we show that the multiplex topology is fundamentally more powerful than individual layers in predicting the ordering with which words are acquired.
result_label: Furthermore, multiplex analysis allows for a quantification of distinct phases of lexical acquisition in early learners: while initially all the multiplex layers contribute to word learning, after about month 23 free associations take the lead in driving word acquisition.

TITLE: Complex Networks in Different Languages: A Study of an Emergent Multilingual Encyclopedia
ABSTRACT: background_label: There is an increasing interest to the study of complex networks in an interdisciplinary way.
background_label: Language, as a complex network, has been a part of this study due to its importance in human life.
background_label: Moreover, the Internet has also been at the center of this study by making access to large amounts of information possible.
objective_label: With these ideas in mind, this work aims to evaluate conceptual networks in different languages with the data from a large and open source of information in the Internet, namely Wikipedia.
method_label: As an evolving multilingual encyclopedia that can be edited by any Internet user, Wikipedia is a good example of an emergent complex system.
objective_label: In this paper, different from previous work on conceptual networks which usually concentrated on single languages, we concentrate on possible ways to compare the usages of different languages and possibly the underlying cultures.
method_label: This also involves the analysis of local network properties around certain coneepts in different languages.
method_label: For an initial evaluation, the concept “family” is used to compare the English and German Wikipedias.
result_label: Although, the work is currently at the beginning, the results are promising.

TITLE: Does AS size determine degree in as topology?
ABSTRACT: background_label: In a recent and much celebrated paper, Faloutsos <i>et al.</i> [6] found that the inter Autonomous System (AS) topology exhibits a power-law degree distribution.
background_label: This result was quite unexpected in the networking community, and stirred significant interest in exploring the possible causes of this phenomenon.
background_label: The work of Barabasi <i>et al.</i> [2], and its application to network topology generation in the work of Medina <i>et al.</i> [9], have explored a promising class of models that yield strict power-law degree distributions.
background_label: These models, which we will refer to collectively as the <i>B-A model</i>, describe the detailed dynamics of the network growth process, modeling the way in which connections are made between ASs.
method_label: There are two simple connectivity rules that define the evolution of AS connectivity over time: <i>incremental growth</i> where a new AS connects to existing ASs, and <i>preferential connectivity</i> where the likelihood of connecting to an AS is proportional to the vertex outdegree of the target AS.
method_label: These simple rules, which are similar to the classical "rich get richer" model originally proposed by Simon [12], lead to power-law degree distributions.
result_label: While the B-A model provably yields power-law vertex degree distributions, recent empirical evidence indicates that the model may not be consistent with the dynamics underlying the evolution of the actual AS topology.
result_label: First, there is strong evidence [3, 4] that the degree distribution of the actual AS topology does not conform to a strict power law.
result_label: However, the distribution is certainly <i>heavy-tailed</i> or <i>highly-variable</i> in the sense that the observed vertex degrees typically range over three or four orders of magnitude; in some cases, the <i>tail</i> of the degree distribution may fit a power law.
background_label: These observations were gleaned from more complete pictures of AS - level connectivity (obtained by augmenting BGP route tables with peering relationships from other sources) than those used by earlier work [2, 6, 9].
background_label: Second, the B-A model's AS connectivity evolution rules can be shown to be inconsistent with empirical AS growth measurements [16].
background_label: As such, while the B-A model appears to produce topologies whose degree distribution characteristics exhibit power-law behavior, it cannot be a valid <i>explanation</i> for the connectivity evolution in the AS topology.
background_label: Clearly, some of these empirical observations don't corroborate the claim that the B-A model explains the phenomenon of highly variable vertex degrees in the Internet's AS topology [2].
background_label: However, the B-A model was originally proposed as a simple illustration of how some elementary mechanisms or rules can give rise to power law vertex degree distributions.
background_label: As such, it is likely that the B-A model can be modified to accommodate these more recent findings [1], but we will neither discuss here such modifications nor comment on their possibility for success.
method_label: Instead, we merely note that any such resulting model would seek, as does the original B-A model, to explain the highly variable degree distribution of the AS topology through the detailed dynamics of how connections between ASs are established.
objective_label: The purpose of this note is to raise the question --- motivated by the B-A approach---of whether the underlying cause of the high variability phenomenon of the vertex degree distribution lies in the detailed dynamics of network growth, or if there are alternative explanations.
method_label: To that end, we briefly outline an alternative explanation for the AS topology degree distribution.
result_label: We do not claim to have proven that this explanation holds; our purpose here is merely to expand the dialog to a larger class of explanations for the variability of the AS topology degree distribution.

TITLE: Universality of Rank-Ordering Distributions in the Arts and Sciences
ABSTRACT: background_label: Searching for generic behaviors has been one of the driving forces leading to a deep understanding and classification of diverse phenomena.
background_label: Usually a starting point is the development of a phenomenology based on observations.
background_label: Such is the case for power law distributions encountered in a wealth of situations coming from physics, geophysics, biology, lexicography as well as social and financial networks.
background_label: This finding is however restricted to a range of values outside of which finite size corrections are often invoked.
method_label: Here we uncover a universal behavior of the way in which elements of a system are distributed according to their rank with respect to a given property, valid for the full range of values, regardless of whether or not a power law has previously been suggested.
result_label: We propose a two parameter functional form for these rank-ordered distributions that gives excellent fits to an impressive amount of very diverse phenomena, coming from the arts, social and natural sciences.
background_label: It is a discrete version of a generalized beta distribution, given by f(r) = A(N+1-r)(b)/r(a), where r is the rank, N its maximum value, A the normalization constant and (a, b) two fitting exponents.
background_label: Prompted by our genetic sequence observations we present a growth probabilistic model incorporating mutation-duplication features that generates data complying with this distribution.
method_label: The competition between permanence and change appears to be a relevant, though not necessary feature.
result_label: Additionally, our observations mainly of social phenomena suggest that a multifactorial quality resulting from the convergence of several heterogeneous underlying processes is an important feature.
result_label: We also explore the significance of the distribution parameters and their classifying potential.
result_label: The ubiquity of our findings suggests that there must be a fundamental underlying explanation, most probably of a statistical nature, such as an appropriate central limit theorem formulation.

TITLE: Emergence of a non-scaling degree distribution in bipartite networks: a numerical and analytical study
ABSTRACT: background_label: We study the growth of bipartite networks in which the number of nodes in one of the partitions is kept fixed while the other partition is allowed to grow.
background_label: We study random and preferential attachment as well as combination of both.
method_label: We derive the exact analytical expression for the degree-distribution of all these different types of attachments while assuming that edges are incorporated sequentially, i.e., a single edge is added to the growing network in a time step.
method_label: We also provide an approximate expression for the case when more than one edge are added in a time step.
result_label: We show that depending on the relative weight between random and preferential attachment, the degree-distribution of this type of network falls into one of four possible regimes which range from a binomial distribution for pure random attachment to an u-shaped distribution for dominant preferential attachment.

TITLE: Complex networks -- Augmenting the framework for the study of complex systems
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract.We briefly describe the toolkit used for studying complex systems: nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, and network theory.
background_label: We place particular emphasis on network theory--the topic of this special issue--and its importance in augmenting the framework for the quantitative study of complex systems.
method_label: In order to illustrate the main issues, we briefly review several areas where network theory has led to significant developments in our understanding of complex systems.
method_label: Specifically, we discuss changes, arising from network theory, in our understanding of (i) the Internet and other communication networks, (ii) the structure of natural ecosystems, (iii) the spread of diseases and information, (iv) the structure of cellular signalling networks, and (v) infrastructure robustness.
result_label: Finally, we discuss how complexity requires both new tools and an augmentation of the conceptual framework--including an expanded definition of what is meant by a “quantitative prediction.”

TITLE: Complex networks and human language
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper introduces how human languages can be studied in light of recent development of network theories.
background_label: There are two directions of exploration.
objective_label: One is to study networks existing in the language system.
method_label: Various lexical networks can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or syntactic.
method_label: Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit small-world and scale-free features.
other_label: The other direction of exploration is to study networks of language users (i.e.
background_label: social networks of people in the linguistic community), and their role in language evolution.
background_label: Social networks also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by random or regular network models.
background_label: In the past, computational models of language change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures may affect the dynamics.
method_label: In the second part of the paper, a series of simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for modeling language change.
method_label: Four types of social networks are compared, which exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics.
result_label: While the questions about which type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.

TITLE: Study of the Brain Waves for the differentiation of Gamers category between a Newbie and a Hardcore in the game Dota 1
ABSTRACT: background_label: The gamers are players, the nickname is given due to their love of video games, there are categories that characterize gamers: Newbie is the player who is starting to play videogames, Hardcore are who already have knowledge previous of the game and know what is the theme of the same and Professional who are the most experienced players who participate in international tournaments and promoting certain brands.
background_label: It is known that each category of gamers provides a different brain interaction, because of that it is required to know what is the clearest difference by comparing 2 gamers, a Newbie and a Hardcore.
method_label: It took data from gamers, a Newbie and a Hardcore to know their brain interaction for this was used Cyton and Daysi Boards that are devices capable of receiving brain data, in addition to using the connection 10-20 for the placement of the electrodes, being these 16 channels (Fp1, Fp2, C3, C4, T5, T6, O1, O2, F7, F8, F3, F4, T3, T4, P3 and P4).
result_label: The obtaining data was when the gamers were playing DOTA 1, having 22 minutes analyzed in both parts, with a sampling frequency of 250 and obtaining 128 data per second.
result_label: Having as a result that in the channels F7 and P3 in the frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz a difference of signals, due to their separation indicating the difference of the cerebral interaction of the players, showing that the hardcore brainwave has more potential than the newbie brainwave in those channels.

TITLE: On the study of network coding with diversity
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recently proposed physical-layer network coding (PNC) has demonstrated the promise to significantly improve the throughput of wireless networks whose links can be modeled as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
background_label: However, the extension to multipath channels is problematic, since the technique would then require both amplitude and phase compensation at each transmitter.
background_label: Phase compensation requires accurate distributed phase tracking, whereas the required amplitude compensation is even more troubling, as it leads to an inefficient system that yields no diversity even in the presence of perfect channel estimates.
method_label: Here, a system that avoids these limitations is obtained by reaching up one level higher in the network hierarchy and performing distributed relay selection with cognizance of the PNC technique that we will employ at the physical layer.
method_label: Since the resulting scheme will achieve a form of selection diversity, we term it ldquonetwork coding with diversityrdquo (NCD).
method_label: To facilitate performance evaluation, two information-theoretic metrics, the outage and ergodic capacity, are studied.
result_label: Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves more robust performance and higher system throughput than comparable schemes.
result_label: Finally, the proposed network coding is extended to the context of cooperative multiple access channels, which yields a new cooperative protocol with larger outage and ergodic capacity compared with existing transmission schemes.

TITLE: Gelada vocal sequences follow Menzerath's linguistic law.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Identifying universal principles underpinning diverse natural systems is a key goal of the life sciences.
objective_label: A powerful approach in addressing this goal has been to test whether patterns consistent with linguistic laws are found in nonhuman animals.
background_label: Menzerath's law is a linguistic law that states that, the larger the construct, the smaller the size of its constituents.
objective_label: Here, to our knowledge, we present the first evidence that Menzerath's law holds in the vocal communication of a nonhuman species.
method_label: We show that, in vocal sequences of wild male geladas (Theropithecus gelada), construct size (sequence size in number of calls) is negatively correlated with constituent size (duration of calls).
method_label: Call duration does not vary significantly with position in the sequence, but call sequence composition does change with sequence size and most call types are abbreviated in larger sequences.
method_label: We also find that intercall intervals follow the same relationship with sequence size as do calls.
result_label: Finally, we provide formal mathematical support for the idea that Menzerath's law reflects compression-the principle of minimizing the expected length of a code.
result_label: Our findings suggest that a common principle underpins human and gelada vocal communication, highlighting the value of exploring the applicability of linguistic laws in vocal systems outside the realm of language.

TITLE: Genetic and environmental structure of adjectives describing the domains of the Big Five Model of personality : A nationwide US twin study
ABSTRACT: background_label: We applied multivariate models specifying genetic and environmental influences on adjectives describing each of the five personality domains specified in the Big Five Model of personality (BFM; Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness).
method_label: We selected the specific models to partition the observed covariance among the adjectives describing each domain into genetic and environmental components in order to assess the etiologic basis for each domain's phenotypic coherence.
method_label: The sample on which our analyses were based was part of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS).
method_label: It consisted of 315 monozygotic and 275 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs.
result_label: Results revealed both common and specific genetic and environmental influences for each domain, suggesting that all of the domains are etiologically complex.
result_label: Models specifying the domains as latent phenotypic constructs fit more poorly than models suggesting more complex structures for all domains except Extraversion and Neuroticism.
result_label: These results raise questions about the BFM as a coherent model of genetic and environmental influences on personality or, alternatively, about the etiological unity of latent phenotypic personality trait constructs beyond Extraversion and Neuroticism.

background_label: However, we favor an approach that centers on one additional ingredient: autonomy.
objective_label: In particular, we aim toward agents that can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human hand-engineering.
method_label: We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not available.
result_label: Here we survey several important examples of the progress that has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities, and highlight some outstanding challenges.

TITLE: The Wildcat Corpus of native- and foreign-accented English: communicative efficiency across conversational dyads with varying language alignment profiles.
ABSTRACT: method_label: This paper describes the development of the Wildcat Corpus of native- and foreign-accented English,a corpus containing scripted and spontaneous speech recordings from 24 native speakers of American English and 52 non-native speakers of English.The core element of this corpus is a set of spontaneous speech recordings, for which a new method of eliciting dialogue-based, laboratory-quality speech recordings was developed (the Diapix task).
result_label: Dialogues between two native speakers of English, between two non-native speakers of English (with either shared or different LIs), and between one native and one non-native speaker of English are included and analyzed in terms of general measures of communicative efficiency.The overall finding was that pairs of native talkers were most efficient, followed by mixed native/non-native pairs and non-native pairs with shared LI.
result_label: Non-native pairs with different LIs were least efficient.These results support the hypothesis that successful speech communication depends both on the alignment of talkers to the target language and on the alignment of talkers to one another in terms of native language background.

TITLE: Unveiling co-evolutionary patterns in systems of cities: a systematic exploration of the SimpopNet model
ABSTRACT: background_label: Co-evolutionary processes are according to the evolutive urban theory at the center of urban systems dynamics.
background_label: Their empirical observation or within models of simulation remains however relatively rare.
objective_label: This chapter is focused on the co-evolution of transportation networks and cities and applies high performance computing numerical experiments to the SimpopNet co-evolution model in order to understand its behavior.
method_label: We introduce specific indicators to quantify trajectories of such models for systems of cities, and apply these to exhibit co-evolutionary regimes of the model.
result_label: This illustrates how the systematic exploration of a simulation model can qualitatively transform the knowledge it provides.

TITLE: Diana in the World of Men: a character network approach to analysing gendered vocal representation in Wonder Woman
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTAs a big-budget action film both directed by and starring a woman, Wonder Woman is unusual given the well-documented under-representation of women in Hollywood both in front of and behind the camera.
background_label: Strong claims have been made about Wonder Woman in the critical reception, with Diana, the film’s hero, being hailed as an empowered, independent leader.
background_label: While there is a lot of literature on the visual aspects of gendered representation, there is a lack of research focusing on gender disparities in film dialogue despite a history of feminist theoretical work on the suppression of the female voice in Hollywood cinema.
method_label: In this article, I present an approach which allows for the empirical analysis of gendered dialogue in film.
method_label: I use the methods of social network analysis to develop a character networks approach to analysing vocal representation in Wonder Woman and compare the results with two other recent films: Thor (2011), and The Hunger Games (2012).

TITLE: Modeling self-organization of vocabularies under phonological similarity effects
ABSTRACT: background_label: This work develops a computational model (by Automata Networks) of phonological similarity effects involved in the formation of word-meaning associations on artificial populations of speakers.
background_label: Classical studies show that in recalling experiments memory performance was impaired for phonologically similar words versus dissimilar ones.
background_label: Here, the individuals confound phonologically similar words according to a predefined parameter.
method_label: The main hypothesis is that there is a critical range of the parameter, and with this, of working-memory mechanisms, which implies drastic changes in the final consensus of the entire population.
result_label: Theoretical results present proofs of convergence for a particular case of the model within a worst-case complexity framework.
result_label: Computer simulations describe the evolution of an energy function that measures the amount of local agreement between individuals.
result_label: The main finding is the appearance of sudden changes in the energy function at critical parameters.

TITLE: Quasi-independence, homology and the unity of type: A topological theory of characters
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper Lewontin's notion of "quasi-independence" of characters is formalized as the assumption that a region of the phenotype space can be represented by a product space of orthogonal factors.
background_label: In this picture each character corresponds to a factor of a region of the phenotype space.
background_label: We consider any region of the phenotype space that has a given factorization as a "type", i.e.
method_label: as a set of phenotypes that share the same set of phenotypic characters.
method_label: Using the notion of local factorizations we develop a theory of character identity based on the continuation of common factors among different regions of the phenotype space.
method_label: We also consider the topological constraints on evolutionary transitions among regions with different regional factorizations, i.e.
result_label: for the evolution of new types or body plans.
background_label: It is shown that direct transition between different "types" is only possible if the transitional forms have all the characters that the ancestral and the derived types have and are thus compatible with the factorization of both types.
background_label: Transitional forms thus have to go over a "complexity hump" where they have more quasi-independent characters than either the ancestral as well as the derived type.
background_label: The only logical, but biologically unlikely, alternative is a "hopeful monster" that transforms in a single step from the ancestral type to the derived type.
method_label: Topological considerations also suggest a new factor that may contribute to the evolutionary stability of "types".
other_label: It is shown that if the type is decomposable into factors which are vertex irregular (i.e.
method_label: have states that are more or less preferred in a random walk), the region of phenotypes representing the type contains islands of strongly preferred states.
result_label: In other words types have a statistical tendency of retaining evolutionary trajectories within their interior and thus add to the evolutionary persistence of types.

TITLE: Competition-Induced Preferential Attachment
ABSTRACT: background_label: Models based on preferential attachment have had much success in reproducing the power law degree distributions which seem ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems.
background_label: Here, rather than assuming preferential attachment, we give an explanation of how it can arise from a more basic underlying mechanism of competition between opposing forces.
method_label: We introduce a family of one-dimensional geometric growth models, constructed iteratively by locally optimizing the tradeoffs between two competing metrics.
method_label: This family admits an equivalent description as a graph process with no reference to the underlying geometry.
method_label: Moreover, the resulting graph process is shown to be preferential attachment with an upper cutoff.
method_label: We rigorously determine the degree distribution for the family of random graph models, showing that it obeys a power law up to a finite threshold and decays exponentially above this threshold.
method_label: We also introduce and rigorously analyze a generalized version of our graph process, with two natural parameters, one corresponding to the cutoff and the other a ``fertility'' parameter.
method_label: Limiting cases of this process include the standard Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model and the uniform attachment model.
result_label: In the general case, we prove that the process has a power law degree distribution up to a cutoff, and establish monotonicity of the power as a function of the two parameters.

TITLE: Preferential Attachment in Online Networks: Measurement and Explanations
ABSTRACT: background_label: We perform an empirical study of the preferential attachment phenomenon in temporal networks and show that on the Web, networks follow a nonlinear preferential attachment model in which the exponent depends on the type of network considered.
background_label: The classical preferential attachment model for networks by Barab\'asi and Albert (1999) assumes a linear relationship between the number of neighbors of a node in a network and the probability of attachment.
background_label: Although this assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the underlying linearity is rarely measured.
method_label: To fill this gap, this paper performs an empirical longitudinal (time-based) study on forty-seven diverse Web network datasets from seven network categories and including directed, undirected and bipartite networks.
method_label: We show that contrary to the usual assumption, preferential attachment is nonlinear in the networks under consideration.
result_label: Furthermore, we observe that the deviation from linearity is dependent on the type of network, giving sublinear attachment in certain types of networks, and superlinear attachment in others.
method_label: Thus, we introduce the preferential attachment exponent $\beta$ as a novel numerical network measure that can be used to discriminate different types of networks.
result_label: We propose explanations for the behavior of that network measure, based on the mechanisms that underly the growth of the network in question.

TITLE: Ceramic style change and neutral evolution: a case study from Neolithic Europe
ABSTRACT: background_label: Following on the work of Dunnell, the evolutionary archaeology school has made a sharp distinction between functional and stylistic variation in archaeological artifacts.
background_label: Variation is defined as functional if it is affected by selection processes and as stylistic if it is a result of processes of random drift.
background_label: The argument has been further developed by Neiman (1995), who showed by simulation that processes of cultural mutation and drift could produce the kinds of battleship curves that generally characterize artifact-style frequency distributions through time, and also demonstrated that they could account for patterns of stylistic variation through time in Woodland-period ceramic assemblages from Illinois.
objective_label: In this paper we present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery from early Neolithic Central Europe.
method_label: We show that the actual diachronic frequency distributions and those expected under the neutral model do not coincide and conclude that in this case the neutral model does not provide an adequate description of change in ceramic decoration.
result_label: A model involving selection, in the form of a bias in favor of novelty in the later phases of the period studied, seems likely to be more appropriate, and we note the social interpretation of the original investigator of the data.
result_label: In conclusion, it is suggested that neutral models provide an important heuristic tool but that there is not a radical break between functional and stylistic variation.

TITLE: Sufficient Conditions for Coarse-Graining Evolutionary Dynamics
ABSTRACT: background_label: It is commonly assumed that the ability to track the frequencies of a set of schemata in the evolving population of an infinite population genetic algorithm (IPGA) under different fitness functions will advance efforts to obtain a theory of adaptation for the simple GA.
background_label: Unfortunately, for IPGAs with long genomes and non-trivial fitness functions there do not currently exist theoretical results that allow such a study.
objective_label: We develop a simple framework for analyzing the dynamics of an infinite population evolutionary algorithm (IPEA).
method_label: This framework derives its simplicity from its abstract nature.
method_label: In particular we make no commitment to the data-structure of the genomes, the kind of variation performed, or the number of parents involved in a variation operation.
method_label: We use this framework to derive abstract conditions under which the dynamics of an IPEA can be coarse-grained.
result_label: We then use this result to derive concrete conditions under which it becomes computationally feasible to closely approximate the frequencies of a family of schemata of relatively low order over multiple generations, even when the bitstsrings in the evolving population of the IPGA are long.

TITLE: Scholarly gratitude in five geographical contexts: a diachronic and cross-generic approach of the acknowledgment paratext in medical discourse (1950–2010)
ABSTRACT: background_label: This study analyzed the use of acknowledgements in medical articles published in five countries (Venezuela, Spain, France, UK and USA) from 1950 to 2010.
method_label: For each country, we selected 54 papers (18 research papers, 18 reviews and 18 case reports), evenly distributed over six decades, from two medical journals with the highest impact factors.
method_label: Only papers written by native speakers in the national language were included.
method_label: The evolution of the frequency and length of acknowledgments was analyzed.
result_label: Of 270 articles studied, 127 (47%) had acknowledgments.
result_label: The presence of acknowledgments was associated with country (p = 0.001), this section being more common and longer in US and UK journals.
background_label: Acknowledgments were most common in research papers (70 vs. 40% in case reports and 31% in reviews, p < 0.001).
background_label: Reviews without acknowledgments were significantly more common than those with (69 vs. 31%), but there was no trend in case reports.
background_label: Altogether, articles with acknowledgments predominated only after 2000.
background_label: Since the frequency of use of acknowledgments remained stable over time in US and UK journals but increased in non-Anglophone journals, the overall increase is attributed to the change in non-English publications.
result_label: Authors acknowledged sub-authorship more in English language journals than in those published in the national language in France, Spain and Venezuela.
result_label: However, the practice of acknowledging is increasing in non-Anglophone journals.
result_label: We conclude that the concept of intellectual indebtedness does not only differ from one geographical context to another, but also over time and from one academic genre to another.

TITLE: Some mathematical problems concerning the ecological principle of competitive exclusion
ABSTRACT: background_label: The ecological principle of competitive exclusion asserts that two species cannot indefinitely occupy the same niche [Sj.
background_label: Attempts have been made to state this principle as a mathematical theorem.
background_label: A standard example is due to Volterra [14].
background_label: (See Example 2.1 below.)
background_label: He constructed a model of two species competing for a single resource and showed that one of the species must go extinct.
result_label: Although the concept of niche is rather vague, it is generally agreed that Volterra’s model is an example of two species competing for the same niche and is therefore an illustration of the principle of competitive exclusion.
background_label: The generalizations of Volterra’s model have dealt largely with the introduction of more realistic assumptions about the interactions between species.
background_label: These assumptions have led to some interesting mathematical problems, many of them unsolved.
objective_label: The purpose of this paper is to state these problems precisely, to give proofs of the known results, and to indicate the unanswered questions.
objective_label: The basic object of study is an idealized ecological community consisting of a certain number of species living together in an isolated geographical area.
method_label: We shall assume that the community interactions are independent of both space and time and that each species is distributed uniformly over the region.
method_label: The basic variables are the population densities of each of the species.

TITLE: Mental Lexicon Growth Modelling Reveals the Multiplexity of the English Language
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this work we extend previous analyses of linguistic networks by adopting a multi-layer network framework for modelling the human mental lexicon, i.e.
background_label: an abstract mental repository where words and concepts are stored together with their linguistic patterns.
method_label: Across a three-layer linguistic multiplex, we model English words as nodes and connect them according to (i) phonological similarities, (ii) synonym relationships and (iii) free word associations.
objective_label: Our main aim is to exploit this multi-layered structure to explore the influence of phonological and semantic relationships on lexicon assembly over time.
method_label: We propose a model of lexicon growth which is driven by the phonological layer: words are suggested according to different orderings of insertion (e.g.
method_label: shorter word length, highest frequency, semantic multiplex features) and accepted or rejected subject to constraints.
method_label: We then measure times of network assembly and compare these to empirical data about the age of acquisition of words.
result_label: In agreement with empirical studies in psycholinguistics, our results provide quantitative evidence for the hypothesis that word acquisition is driven by features at multiple levels of organisation within language.

TITLE: Statistical Genetics and Evolution of Quantitative Traits
ABSTRACT: background_label: The distribution and heritability of many traits depends on numerous loci in the genome.
background_label: In general, the astronomical number of possible genotypes makes the system with large numbers of loci difficult to describe.
background_label: Multilocus evolution, however, greatly simplifies in the limit of weak selection and frequent recombination.
background_label: In this limit, populations rapidly reach Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) in which the dynamics of the full genotype distribution, including correlations between alleles at different loci, can be parameterized by the allele frequencies.
objective_label: This review provides a simplified exposition of the concept and mathematics of QLE which is central to the statistical description of genotypes in sexual populations.
method_label: We show how key results of Quantitative Genetics such as the generalized Fisher's"Fundamental Theorem", along with Wright's Adaptive Landscape, emerge within QLE from the dynamics of the genotype distribution.
method_label: We then discuss under what circumstances QLE is applicable, and what the breakdown of QLE implies for the population structure and the dynamics of selection.
result_label: Understanding of the fundamental aspects of multilocus evolution obtained through simplified models may be helpful in providing conceptual and computational tools to address the challenges arising in the studies of complex quantitative phenotypes of practical interest.

ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper studies the effect of linguistic constraints on the large scale organization of language.
background_label: It describes the properties of linguistic networks built using texts of written language with the words randomized.
method_label: These properties are compared to those obtained for a network built over the text in natural order.

result_label: This is indeed a surprising result - one that has not been addressed adequately in the literature.

TITLE: Morphological Organization: The Low Conditional Entropy Conjecture
ABSTRACT: background_label: Crosslinguistically, inflectional morphology exhibits a spectacular range of complexity in both the structure of individual words and the organization of systems that words participate in.
background_label: We distinguish two dimensions in the analysis of morphological complexity.
background_label: enumerative complexity (E-complexity) reflects the number of morphosyntactic distinctions that languages make and the strategies employed to encode them, concerning either the internal composition of words or the arrangement of classes of words into inflection classes.
method_label: This, we argue, is constrained by integrative complexity (I-complexity).
method_label: The I-complexity of an inflectional system reflects the difficulty that a paradigmatic system poses for language users (rather than lexicographers) in information-theoretic terms.
method_label: This becomes clear by distinguishing average paradigm entropy from average conditional entropy .
result_label: The average entropy of a paradigm is the uncertainty in guessing the realization for a particular cell of the paradigm of a particular lexeme (given knowledge of the possible exponents).
background_label: This gives one a measure of the complexity of a morphological system—systems with more exponents and more inflection classes will in general have higher average paradigm entropy—but it presupposes a problem that adult native speakers will never encounter.
background_label: In order to know that a lexeme exists, the speaker must have heard at least one word form, so in the worst case a speaker will be faced with predicting a word form based on knowledge of one other word form of that lexeme.
background_label: Thus, a better measure of morphological complexity is the average conditional entropy, the average uncertainty in guessing the realization of one randomly selected cell in the paradigm of a lexeme given the realization of one other randomly selected cell.
background_label: This is the I-complexity of paradigm organization.
method_label: Viewed from this information-theoretic perspective, languages that appear to differ greatly in their E-complexity—the number of exponents, inflectional classes, and principal parts—can actually be quite similar in terms of the challenge they pose for a language user who already knows how the system works.
method_label: We adduce evidence for this hypothesis from three sources: a comparison between languages of varying degrees of E-complexity, a case study from the particularly challenging conjugational system of Chiquihuitlan Mazatec, and a Monte Carlo simulation modeling the encoding of morphosyntactic properties into formal expressions.
result_label: The results of these analyses provide evidence for the crucial status of words and paradigms for understanding morphological organization.

TITLE: Role of social environment and social clustering in spread of opinions in co-evolving networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Taking a pragmatic approach to the processes involved in the phenomena of collective opinion formation, we investigate two specific modifications to the co-evolving network voter model of opinion formation, studied by Holme and Newman [1].
method_label: First, we replace the rewiring probability parameter by a distribution of probability of accepting or rejecting opinions between individuals, accounting for the asymmetric influences in relationships among individuals in a social group.
method_label: Second, we modify the rewiring step by a path-length-based preference for rewiring that reinforces local clustering.
method_label: We have investigated the influences of these modifications on the outcomes of the simulations of this model.
result_label: We found that varying the shape of the distribution of probability of accepting or rejecting opinions can lead to the emergence of two qualitatively distinct final states, one having several isolated connected components each in internal consensus leading to the existence of diverse set of opinions and the other having one single dominant connected component with each node within it having the same opinion.
background_label: Furthermore, and more importantly, we found that the initial clustering in network can also induce similar transitions.
objective_label: Our investigation also brings forward that these transitions are governed by a weak and complex dependence on system size.
result_label: We found that the networks in the final states of the model have rich structural properties including the small world property for some parameter regimes.

TITLE: Is the rate of linguistic change constant
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract The computer simulation of language change in a finite, structured population which was presented in an earlier paper (‘Using Social Impact Theory to simulate language change’, Lingua 108, 95–117, 1999), is here extended to speech communities of different sizes.
objective_label: On the basis of the results it is proposed 1.
method_label: (a) that language change may be faster in small communities; 2.
method_label: (b) that linguistic borrowing is one sense more likely in small communities; and 3.
method_label: (c) that the evolution of linguistically marked structures is more likely in small communities.
result_label: It is argued that these three generalisations could be used to make sense of the different patterns of linguistic diversity observed in the Old and New Worlds, and the distribution of marked word orders in the world's languages.

TITLE: Cognitive resource allocation determines the organization of personal networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: The typical human personal social network contains about 150 relationships including kin, friends, and acquaintances, organized into a set of hierarchically inclusive layers of increasing size but decreasing emotional intensity.
background_label: Data from a number of different sources reveal that these inclusive layers exhibit a constant scaling ratio of [Formula: see text] While the overall size of the networks has been connected to our cognitive capacity, no mechanism explaining why the networks present a layered structure with a consistent scaling has been proposed.
method_label: Here we show that the existence of a heterogeneous cost to relationships (in terms of time or cognitive investment), together with a limitation in the total capacity an individual has to invest in them, can naturally explain the existence of layers and, when the cost function is linear, explain the scaling between them.
method_label: We develop a one-parameter Bayesian model that fits the empirical data remarkably well.
method_label: In addition, the model predicts the existence of a contrasting regime in the case of small communities, such that the layers have an inverted structure (increasing size with increasing emotional intensity).
method_label: We test the model with five communities and provide clear evidence of the existence of the two predicted regimes.
result_label: Our model explains, based on first principles, the emergence of structure in the organization of personal networks and allows us to predict a rare phenomenon whose existence we confirm empirically.

background_label: All linguistic levels have to deal with an astronomic combinatorial potential that stems from the recursive nature of languages.
background_label: This recursiveness is indeed a key defining trait.
background_label: However, not all words are equally combined nor frequent.
background_label: In breaking the symmetry between less and more often used and between less and more meaning-bearing units, universal scaling laws arise.
background_label: Such laws, common to all human languages, appear on different stages from word inventories to networks of interacting words.
background_label: Among these seemingly universal traits exhibited by language networks, ambiguity appears to be a specially relevant component.
background_label: Ambiguity is avoided in most computational approaches to language processing, and yet it seems to be a crucial element of language architecture.
method_label: Here we review the evidence both from language network architecture and from theoretical reasonings based on a least effort argument.
result_label: Ambiguity is shown to play an essential role in providing a source of language efficiency, and is likely to be an inevitable byproduct of network growth.

TITLE: Models for measurement, precision, and the nondichotomization of graded responses
ABSTRACT: background_label: It is common in educational, psychological, and social measurement in general, to collect data in the form of graded responses and then to combine adjacent categories.
background_label: It has been argued that because the division of the continuum into categories is arbitrary, any model used for analyzing graded responses should accommodate such action.
background_label: Specifically, Jansen and Roskam (1986) enunciate ajoining assumption which specifies that if two categoriesj andk are combined to form categoryh, then the probability of a response inh should equal the sum of the probabilities of responses inj andk.
background_label: As a result, they question the use of the Rasch model for graded responses which explicitly prohibits the combining of categories after the data are collected except in more or less degenerate cases.
background_label: However, the Rasch model is derived from requirements of invariance of comparisons of entities with respect to different instruments, which might include different partitions of the continuum, and is consistent with fundamental measurement.
background_label: Therefore, there is a strong case that the mathematical implication of the Rasch model should be studied further in order to understand how and why it conflicts with the joining assumption.
method_label: This paper pursues the mathematics of the Rasch model and establishes, through a special case when the sizes of the categories are equal and when the model is expressed in the multiplicative metric, that its probability distribution reflects the precision with which the data are collected, and that if a pair of categories is collapsed after the data are collected, it no longer reflects the original precision.
result_label: As a consequence, and not because of a qualitative change in the variable, the joining assumption is destroyed when categories are combined.
result_label: Implications of the choice between a model which satisfies the joining assumption or one which reflects on the precision of the data collection considered are discussed.

TITLE: Patterns in syntactic dependency networks.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many languages are spoken on Earth.
background_label: Despite their diversity, many robust language universals are known to exist.
background_label: All languages share syntax, i.e., the ability of combining words for forming sentences.
background_label: The origin of such traits is an issue of open debate.
method_label: By using recent developments from the statistical physics of complex networks, we show that different syntactic dependency networks (from Czech, German, and Romanian) share many nontrivial statistical patterns such as the small world phenomenon, scaling in the distribution of degrees, and disassortative mixing.
result_label: Such previously unreported features of syntax organization are not a trivial consequence of the structure of sentences, but an emergent trait at the global scale.
