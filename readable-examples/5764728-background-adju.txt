TITLE: Embedding Web-based Statistical Translation Models in Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Although more and more language pairs are covered by machine translation services, there are still many pairs that lack translation resources.
background_label: Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is an application which needs translation functionality of a relatively low level of sophistication since current models for information retrieval (IR) are still based on a bag-of-words.
background_label: The Web provides a vast resource for the automatic construction of parallel corpora which can be used to train statistical translation models automatically.
background_label: The resulting translation models can be embedded in several ways in a retrieval model.
objective_label: In this paper, we will investigate the problem of automatically mining parallel texts from the Web and different ways of integrating the translation models within the retrieval process.
result_label: Our experiments on standard test collections for CLIR show that the Web-based translation models can surpass commercial MT systems in CLIR tasks.
result_label: These results open the perspective of constructing a fully automatic query translation device for CLIR at a very low cost.

TITLE: Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other languages.
objective_label: This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query.
background_label: In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another.
objective_label: However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents.
objective_label: Specific translation methods are thus required.
objective_label: The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specifi c problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems.
result_label: The book starts with a general description of the monolingual IR and CLIR problems.
background_label: Different classes of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an MT system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel and comparable corpora.
background_label: In addition, the typical retrieval effectiveness using different approaches is compared.
method_label: It will be shown that translation approaches specifically designed for CLIR can rival and outperform high-quality MT systems.
method_label: Finally, the book offers a look into the future that draws a strong parallel between query expansion in monolingual IR and query translation in CLIR, suggesting that many approaches developed in monolingual IR can be adapted to CLIR.
method_label: The book can be used as an introduction to CLIR.
method_label: Advanced readers can also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining research challenges in the future.
result_label: It is suitable to new researchers who intend to carry out research on CLIR.

TITLE: Automatic Cross-Language Retrieval Using Latent Semantic Indexing
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe a method for fully automated cross-language document retrieval in which no query translation is required.
background_label: Queries in one language can retrieve documents in other languages (as well as the original language).
method_label: This is accomplished by a method that automatically constructs a multilingual semantic space using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).
method_label: Strong test results for the cross-language LSI (CLLSI) method are presented for a new French-English collection.
method_label: We also provide evidence that this automatic method performs comparably to a retrieval method based on machine translation (MT-LSI), and explore several practical training methods.
result_label: By all available measures, CL-LSI performs quite well and is widely applicable.

TITLE: A Probabilistic Translation Method for Dictionary-based Cross-lingual Information Retrieval in Agglutinative Languages
ABSTRACT: background_label: Translation ambiguity, out of vocabulary words and missing some translations in bilingual dictionaries make dictionary-based Cross-language Information Retrieval (CLIR) a challenging task.
background_label: Moreover, in agglutinative languages which do not have reliable stemmers, missing various lexical formations in bilingual dictionaries degrades CLIR performance.
objective_label: This paper aims to introduce a probabilistic translation model to solve the ambiguity problem, and also to provide most likely formations of a dictionary candidate.
method_label: We propose Minimum Edit Support Candidates (MESC) method that exploits a monolingual corpus and a bilingual dictionary to translate users' native language queries to documents' language.
result_label: Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dictionary-based English-Persian CLIR.

TITLE: Cross-Language Information Retrieval.
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article addresses a timely problem, especially within the context of the Internet, which is accessible by anyone in any discipline from virtually anywhere in the world.
background_label: The problem of cross-language retrieval is not new.
background_label: Then at now, cross-language information retrieval was seen to be a function that would facilitate the effective search for, exchange of, and retrieval information.
objective_label: This chapter reviews research and practice in CLIR that allows users to state queries in their native language and retrieve documents in any other language supported by the system.
method_label: CLIR can simplify searching by multilingual users and, if translation resources are limited, can allow monolingual users to allocate those resources to the more promising documents.
method_label: This review begins with an examination of the literature on user needs for CLIR.
method_label: The chapter largely follows the retrieval system model (document preprocessing, query formulation, matching, selection, and delivery).
method_label: Each section highlights the unique requirements imposed on one more stages of the model in cross-language retrieval applications.
result_label: The authors describe evaluation techniques and conclude with observations regarding future directions for CLIR research.

TITLE: Statistical cross-language information retrieval using n-best query translations
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper presents a novel statistical model for cross-language information retrieval.
method_label: Given a written query in the source language, documents in the target language are ranked by integrating probabilities computed by two statistical models: a query-translation model, which generates most probable term-by-term translations of the query, and a query-document model, which evaluates the likelihood of each document and translation.
method_label: Integration of the two scores is performed over the set of N most probable translations of the query.
result_label: Experimental results with values N=1, 5, 10 are presented on the Italian-English bilingual track data used in the CLEF 2000 and 2001 evaluation campaigns.

TITLE: Cross-Lingual Learning-to-Rank with Shared Representations
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractCross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) is a document retrieval task where the documents are written in a language different from that of the user's query.
background_label: This is a challenging problem for data-driven approaches due to the general lack of labeled training data.
method_label: We introduce a large-scale dataset derived from Wikipedia to support CLIR research in 25 languages.
method_label: Further, we present a simple yet effective neural learning-to-rank model that shares representations across languages and reduces the data requirement.
result_label: This model can exploit training data in, for example, Japanese-English CLIR to improve the results of Swahili-English CLIR.

TITLE: Evaluating a probabilistic model for cross-lingual information retrieval
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This work proposes and evaluates a probabilistic cross-lingual retrieval system.
background_label: The system uses a generative model to estimate the probability that a document in one language is relevant, given a query in another language.
background_label: An important component of the model is translation probabilities from terms in documents to terms in a query.
method_label: Our approach is evaluated when 1) the only resource is a manually generated bilingual word list, 2) the only resource is a parallel corpus, and 3) both resources are combined in a mixture model.
method_label: The combined resources produce about 90% of monolingual performance in retrieving Chinese documents.
method_label: For Spanish the system achieves 85% of monolingual performance using only a pseudo-parallel Spanish-English corpus.
result_label: Retrieval results are comparable with those of the structural query translation technique (Pirkola, 1998) when bilingual lexicons are used for query translation.
result_label: When parallel texts in addition to conventional lexicons are used, it achieves better retrieval results but requires more computation than the structural query translation technique.
result_label: It also produces slightly better results than using a machine translation system for CLIR, but the improvement over the MT system is not significant.

TITLE: An Improvement in Cross-Language Document Retrieval Based on Statistical Models
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractThis paper presents a proposed method integrated with three statistical models including Translation model, Query generation model and Document retrieval model for cross-language document retrieval.
method_label: Given a certain document in the source language, it will be translated into the target language of statistical machine translation model.
method_label: The query generation model then selects the most relevant words in the translated version of the document as a query.
method_label: Finally, all the documents in the target language are scored by the document searching model, which mainly computes the similarities between query and document.
method_label: This method can efficiently solve the problem of translation ambiguity and query expansion for disambiguation, which are critical in Cross-Language Information Retrieval.
result_label: In addition, the proposed model has been extensively evaluated to the retrieval of documents that: 1) texts are long which, as a result, may cause the model to over generate the queries; and 2) texts are of similar contents under the same topic which is hard to be distinguished by the retrieval model.
result_label: After comparing different strategies, the experimental results show a significant performance of the method with the average precision close to 100%.
result_label: It is of a great significance to both cross-language searching on the Internet and the parallel corpus producing for statistical machine translation systems.

TITLE: Combining Statistical Translation Techniques for Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTCross-language information retrieval today is dominated by techniques that rely principally on context-independent token-to-token mappings despite the fact that state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems now have far richer translation models available in their internal representations.
method_label: This paper explores combination-of-evidence techniques using three types of statistical translation models: context-independent token translation, token translation using phrase-dependent contexts, and token translation using sentence-dependent contexts.
method_label: Context-independent translation is performed using statistically-aligned tokens in parallel text, phrase-dependent translation is performed using aligned statistical phrases, and sentence-dependent translation is performed using those same aligned phrases together with an n-gram language model.
result_label: Experiments on retrieval of Arabic, Chinese, and French documents using English queries show that no one technique is optimal for all queries, but that statistically significant improvements in mean average precision over strong baselines can be achieved by combining translation evidence from all three techniques.
result_label: The optimal combination is, however, found to be resource-dependent, indicating a need for future work on robust tuning to the characteristics of individual collections.

TITLE: Translation techniques in cross-language information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is an active sub-domain of information retrieval (IR).
background_label: Like IR, CLIR is centered on the search for documents and for information contained within those documents.
background_label: Unlike IR, CLIR must reconcile queries and documents that are written in different languages.
background_label: The usual solution to this mismatch involves translating the query and/or the documents before performing the search.
background_label: Translation is therefore a pivotal activity for CLIR engines.
method_label: Over the last 15 years, the CLIR community has developed a wide range of techniques and models supporting free text translation.
result_label: This article presents an overview of those techniques, with a special emphasis on recent developments.

TITLE: Two-stage language models for information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: The optimal settings of retrieval parameters often depend on both the document collection and the query, and are usually found through empirical tuning.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a family of two-stage language models for information retrieval that explicitly captures the different influences of the query and document collection on the optimal settings of retrieval parameters.
method_label: As a special case, we present a two-stage smoothing method that allows us to estimate the smoothing parameters completely automatically.
method_label: In the first stage, the document language model is smoothed using a Dirichlet prior with the collection language model as the reference model.
method_label: In the second stage, the smoothed document language model is further interpolated with a query background language model.
method_label: We propose a leave-one-out method for estimating the Dirichlet parameter of the first stage, and the use of document mixture models for estimating the interpolation parameter of the second stage.
result_label: Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.

TITLE: Japanese/English Cross-Language Information Retrieval: Exploration of Query Translation and Transliteration
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different languages, has of late become one of the major topics within the information retrieval community.
objective_label: This paper proposes a Japanese/English CLIR system, where we combine a query translation and retrieval modules.
background_label: We currently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore the performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation of technical terms.
background_label: However, the technical term translation is still problematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new terms are progressively created by combining existing base words.
background_label: In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
background_label: Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient coverage.
method_label: To counter the first problem, we produce a Japanese/English dictionary for base words, and translate compound words on a word-by-word basis.
method_label: We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambiguity.
method_label: For the second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words unlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the target language.
result_label: We evaluate our system using a test collection for CLIR, and show that both the compound word translation and transliteration methods improve the system performance.

TITLE: Translation discovery using diverse similarity measures
ABSTRACT: background_label: Automatic translation between natural languages using empirical learning methods is an active research area.
background_label: Much of the work in this area is concentrated on acquiring models of translation from expensive resources, including large databases containing hundreds of thousands of translated sentences, which are available for only a small number of the language pairs between which one might wish to translate.
objective_label: This dissertation describes the automatic acquisition of translations into English for unknown foreign language words given the lack of any high-quality translation learning resources, which is the reality for nearly all of the world's languages.
method_label: The methods presented in this dissertation require minimal training supervision; the necessary inputs consist of only a few hundred thousand words of raw news text in a language of interest, such as Uzbek, and a translation dictionary into English for some related language, such as Turkish.
method_label: We show how diverse measures of cross-language word similarity can be combined to learn translations for a considerable subset of the vocabulary of a language for which no translations are initially known.
method_label: These similarities include statistical models of related-language cognate words, various cross-language comparisons of how words are used in monolingual text, and the distribution of terms in dated news articles.
result_label: The ultimate result is a functional translation capability for new language pairs using minimal training resources and almost no human supervision.

TITLE: Exploiting Representations from Statistical Machine Translation for Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: This work explores how internal representations of modern statistical machine translation systems can be exploited for cross-language information retrieval.
objective_label: We tackle two core issues that are central to query translation: how to exploit context to generate more accurate translations and how to preserve ambiguity that may be present in the original query, thereby retaining a diverse set of translation alternatives.
background_label: These two considerations are often in tension since ambiguity in natural language is typically resolved by exploiting context, but effective retrieval requires striking the right balance.
method_label: We propose two novel query translation approaches: the grammar-based approach extracts translation probabilities from translation grammars, while the decoder-based approach takes advantage of n-best translation hypotheses.
method_label: Both are context-sensitive, in contrast to a baseline context-insensitive approach that uses bilingual dictionaries for word-by-word translation.
result_label: Experimental results show that by “opening up” modern statistical machine translation systems, we can access intermediate representations that yield high retrieval effectiveness.
result_label: By combining evidence from multiple sources, we demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines on standard cross-language information retrieval test collections.
result_label: In addition to effectiveness, the efficiency of our techniques are explored as well.

TITLE: Applying Machine Translation to Two-Stage Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different languages, needs a translation of queries and/or documents, so as to standardize both of them into a common representation.
background_label: For this purpose, the use of machine translation is an effective approach.
background_label: However, computational cost is prohibitive in translating large-scale document collections.
method_label: To resolve this problem, we propose a two-stage CLIR method.
method_label: First, we translate a given query into the document language, and retrieve a limited number of foreign documents.
method_label: Second, we machine translate only those documents into the user language, and re-rank them based on the translation result.
result_label: We also show the effectiveness of our method by way of experiments using Japanese queries and English technical documents.

TITLE: Improving query translation for cross-language information retrieval using statistical models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Dictionaries have often been used for query translation in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
background_label: However, we are faced with the problem of translation ambiguity, i.e.
background_label: multiple translations are stored in a dictionary for a word.
background_label: In addition, a word-by-word query translation is not precise enough.
objective_label: In this paper, we explore several methods to improve the previous dictionary-based query translation.
method_label: First, as many as possible, noun phrases are recognized and translated as a whole by using statistical models and phrase translation patterns.
method_label: Second, the best word translations are selected based on the cohesion of the translation words.
result_label: Our experimental results on TREC English-Chinese CLIR collection show that these techniques result in significant improvements over the simple dictionary approaches, and achieve even better performance than a high-quality machine translation system.

TITLE: Exploration and exploitation of multilingual data for statistical machine translation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Shortly after the birth of computer science, researchers realised the importance of machine translation as a task worth of concentrated effort, but it is only recently that algorithms are able to provide automatic translations usable by the masses.
background_label: Modern translation systems are dependent on bilingual corpora, a modern Rosetta Stone, from which the learn cross-lingual relationships that can be used to translate sentences which are not in the training corpus.
background_label: This data is crucial.
background_label: If it is insufficient, or out-of-domain, then translation quality degrades.
method_label: To improve quality, we need to both perfect methods that extract usable translation from additional multilingual resources, and improve the constituent models of a translation system to better exploit existing multilingual data sets.
objective_label: In this thesis, we focus on these dual problems.
background_label: Our approach is two-fold, and the thesis is structures accordingly.
objective_label: In part I we study the problem of extracting translations from the web, with a focus on exploiting the growing predominance of microblog platforms.
method_label: We present novel methods for the language identification of microblog posts, and conduct a thorough analysis of existing methods that explore these microblog posts for new translations.
method_label: In part II we study the orthogonal problem of improving language models for the tasks of reranking and source side morphological analysis.
method_label: We begin by analysing a plethora of syntactic features for reranking n-best lists output from an automatic translation system.
method_label: We then present a novel algorithm that allows for exact inference from high-order hidden Markov models, which we use to segment source text input.
result_label: In this way, the thesis gives insight into the retrieval of relevant training data, and introduces novel methods that better utilise existing multilingual corpora.

TITLE: Improving Performance Of English-Hindi Cross Language Information Retrieval Using Transliteration Of Query Terms
ABSTRACT: background_label: The main issue in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is the poor performance of retrieval in terms of average precision when compared to monolingual retrieval performance.
background_label: The main reasons behind poor performance of CLIR are mismatching of query terms, lexical ambiguity and un-translated query terms.
background_label: The existing problems of CLIR are needed to be addressed in order to increase the performance of the CLIR system.
objective_label: In this paper, we are putting our effort to solve the given problem by proposed an algorithm for improving the performance of English-Hindi CLIR system.
method_label: We used all possible combination of Hindi translated query using transliteration of English query terms and choosing the best query among them for retrieval of documents.
method_label: The experiment is performed on FIRE 2010 (Forum of Information Retrieval Evaluation) datasets.
result_label: The experimental result show that the proposed approach gives better performance of English-Hindi CLIR system and also helps in overcoming existing problems and outperforms the existing English-Hindi CLIR system in terms of average precision.

TITLE: Cross-Lingual Topical Relevance Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractCross-lingual relevance modelling (CLRLM) is a state-of-the-art technique for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) which integrates query term disambiguation and expansion in a unified framework, to directly estimate a model of relevant documents in the target language starting with a query in the source language.
background_label: However, CLRLM involves integrating a translation model either on the document side if a parallel corpus is available, or on the query side if a bilingual dictionary is available.
background_label: For low resourced language pairs, large parallel corpora do not exist and the vocabulary coverage of dictionaries is small, as a result of which RLM-based CLIR fails to obtain satisfactory results.
background_label: Despite the lack of parallel resources for a majority of language pairs, the availability of comparable corpora for many languages has grown considerably in the recent years.
method_label: Existing CLIR techniques such as cross-lingual relevance models, cannot effectively utilize these comparable corpora, since they do not use information from documents in the source language.
result_label: We overcome this limitation by using information from retrieved documents in the source language to improve the retrieval quality of the target language documents.
background_label: More precisely speaking, our model involves a two step approach of first retrieving documents both in the source language and the target language (using query translation), and then improving on the retrieval quality of target language documents by expanding the query with translations of words extracted from the top ranked documents retrieved in the source language which are thematically related (i.e.
method_label: share the same concept) to the words in the top ranked target language documents.
method_label: Our key hypothesis is that the query in the source language and its equivalent target language translation retrieve documents which share topics.
method_label: The ovelapping topics of these top ranked documents in both languages are then used to improve the ranking of the target language documents.
method_label: Since the model relies on the alignment of topics between language pairs, we call it the cross-lingual topical relevance model (CLTRLM).
result_label: Experimental results show that the CLTRLM significantly outperforms the standard CLRLM by upto 37% on English-Bengali CLIR, achieving mean average precision (MAP) of up to 60.27% of the Bengali monolingual IR MAP.

TITLE: XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations
ABSTRACT: background_label: State-of-the-art natural language processing systems rely on supervision in the form of annotated data to learn competent models.
background_label: These models are generally trained on data in a single language (usually English), and cannot be directly used beyond that language.
background_label: Since collecting data in every language is not realistic, there has been a growing interest in cross-lingual language understanding (XLU) and low-resource cross-language transfer.
method_label: In this work, we construct an evaluation set for XLU by extending the development and test sets of the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MultiNLI) to 15 languages, including low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu.
method_label: We hope that our dataset, dubbed XNLI, will catalyze research in cross-lingual sentence understanding by providing an informative standard evaluation task.
method_label: In addition, we provide several baselines for multilingual sentence understanding, including two based on machine translation systems, and two that use parallel data to train aligned multilingual bag-of-words and LSTM encoders.
result_label: We find that XNLI represents a practical and challenging evaluation suite, and that directly translating the test data yields the best performance among available baselines.

TITLE: A Knowledge-based Representation for Cross-Language Document Retrieval and Categorization
ABSTRACT: background_label: Current approaches to cross-language document retrieval and categorization are based on discriminative methods which represent documents in a low-dimensional vector space.
objective_label: In this paper we propose a shift from the supervised to the knowledge-based paradigm and provide a document similarity measure which draws on BabelNet, a large multilingual knowledge resource.
result_label: Our experiments show state-of-the-art results in cross-lingual document retrieval and categorization.

TITLE: Multi-part Representation Learning For Cross-domain Web Content Classification Using Neural Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Owing to the tremendous increase in the volume and variety of user generated content, train-once-apply-forever models are insufficient for supervised learning tasks.
background_label: The need is to develop algorithms that can adapt across domains by leveraging labeled data from source domain(s) and efficiently perform the task in the unlabeled target domain.
method_label: Towards this, we present a novel two-stage neural network learning algorithm for domain adaptation which learns a multi-part hidden layer where individual parts contribute differently to the tasks in source and target domains.
method_label: The multiple parts of the representation (i.e.
method_label: hidden layer) are learned while being cognizant of what characteristics to transfer across domains and what to preserve within domains for enhanced performance.
method_label: The first stage embroils around learning a two-part representation i.e.
method_label: source specific and common representations in a manner such that the former do not detract the ability of the later to represent the target domain.
method_label: In the second stage, the generalized common representation is further iteratively extended with discriminating target specific characteristics to adapt to the target domain.
result_label: We empirically demonstrate that the learned representations, in different arrangements, outperform existing domain adaptation algorithms in the source classification as well as the cross-domain classification tasks on the user generated content from different domains on the web.

TITLE: Triangular Architecture for Rare Language Translation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) performs poor on the low-resource language pair $(X,Z)$, especially when $Z$ is a rare language.
objective_label: By introducing another rich language $Y$, we propose a novel triangular training architecture (TA-NMT) to leverage bilingual data $(Y,Z)$ (may be small) and $(X,Y)$ (can be rich) to improve the translation performance of low-resource pairs.
method_label: In this triangular architecture, $Z$ is taken as the intermediate latent variable, and translation models of $Z$ are jointly optimized with a unified bidirectional EM algorithm under the goal of maximizing the translation likelihood of $(X,Y)$.
result_label: Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the translation quality of rare languages on MultiUN and IWSLT2012 datasets, and achieves even better performance combining back-translation methods.

objective_label: This paper deals with query translation issue in cross-language information retrieval, proper names in particular.
objective_label: Models for name identification, name translation and name searching are presented.
method_label: The recall rates and the precision rates for the identification of Chinese organization names, person names and location names under MET data are (76.67%, 79.33%), (87.33%, 82.33%) and (77.00%, 82.00%), respectively.

TITLE: Cross-language information retrieval models based on latent topic models trained with document-aligned comparable corpora
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we study different applications of cross-language latent topic models trained on comparable corpora.
background_label: The first focus lies on the task of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
objective_label: The Bilingual Latent Dirichlet allocation model (BiLDA) allows us to create an interlingual, language-independent representation of both queries and documents.
method_label: We construct several BiLDA-based document models for CLIR, where no additional translation resources are used.
method_label: The second focus lies on the methods for extracting translation candidates and semantically related words using only per-topic word distributions of the cross-language latent topic model.
method_label: As the main contribution, we combine the two former steps, blending the evidences from the per-document topic distributions and the per-topic word distributions of the topic model with the knowledge from the extracted lexicon.
result_label: We design and evaluate the novel evidence-rich statistical model for CLIR, and prove that such a model, which combines various (only internal) evidences, obtains the best scores for experiments performed on the standard test collections of the CLEF 2001–2003 campaigns.
result_label: We confirm these findings in an alternative evaluation, where we automatically generate queries and perform the known-item search on a test subset of Wikipedia articles.
result_label: The main importance of this work lies in the fact that we train translation resources from comparable document-aligned corpora and provide novel CLIR statistical models that exhaustively exploit as many cross-lingual clues as possible in the quest for better CLIR results, without use of any additional external resources such as parallel corpora or machine-readable dictionaries.

TITLE: Halo: Learning Semantics-Aware Representations for Cross-Lingual Information Extraction
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-lingual information extraction (CLIE) is an important and challenging task, especially in low resource scenarios.
method_label: To tackle this challenge, we propose a training method, called Halo, which enforces the local region of each hidden state of a neural model to only generate target tokens with the same semantic structure tag.
method_label: This simple but powerful technique enables a neural model to learn semantics-aware representations that are robust to noise, without introducing any extra parameter, thus yielding better generalization in both high and low resource settings.

TITLE: Automatic Identification of Document Translations in Large Multilingual Document Collections
ABSTRACT: background_label: Texts and their translations are a rich linguistic resource that can be used to train and test statistics-based Machine Translation systems and many other applications.
method_label: In this paper, we present a working system that can identify translations and other very similar documents among a large number of candidates, by representing the document contents with a vector of thesaurus terms from a multilingual thesaurus, and by then measuring the semantic similarity between the vectors.
method_label: Tests on different text types have shown that the system can detect translations with over 96% precision in a large search space of 820 documents or more.
method_label: The system was tuned to ignore language-specific similarities and to give similar documents in a second language the same similarity score as equivalent documents in the same language.
result_label: The application can also be used to detect cross-lingual document plagiarism.

TITLE: Iterative translation disambiguation for cross-language information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Finding a proper distribution of translation probabilities is one of the most important factors impacting the effectiveness of a cross-language information retrieval system.
objective_label: In this paper we present a new approach that computes translation probabilities for a given query by using only a bilingual dictionary and a monolingual corpus in the target language.
method_label: The algorithm combines term association measures with an iterative machine learning approach based on expectation maximization.
method_label: Our approach considers only pairs of translation candidates and is therefore less sensitive to data-sparseness issues than approaches using higher n-grams.
method_label: The learned translation probabilities are used as query term weights and integrated into a vector-space retrieval system.
result_label: Results for English-German cross-lingual retrieval show substantial improvements over a baseline using dictionary lookup without term weighting.

TITLE: Translation Model Adaptation for Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Topic Information
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractTo adapt a translation model trained from the data in one domain to another, previous works paid more attention to the studies of parallel corpus while ignoring the in-domain monolingual corpora which can be obtained more easily.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translation model adaptation by utilizing in-domain monolingual topic information instead of the in-domain bilingual corpora, which incorporates the topic information into translation probability estimation.
method_label: Our method establishes the relationship between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the in-domain monolingual corpora via topic mapping and phrase-topic distribution probability estimation from in-domain monolingual corpora.
result_label: Experimental result on the NIST Chinese-English translation task shows that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system.

TITLE: Lexical triggers and latent semantic analysis for cross-lingual language model adaptation
ABSTRACT: background_label: In-domain texts for estimating statistical language models are not easily found for most languages of the world.
objective_label: We present two techniques to take advantage of in-domain text resources in other languages.
method_label: First, we extend the notion of <i>lexical triggers</i>, which have been used monolingually for language model adaptation, to the cross-lingual problem, permitting the construction of sharper language models for a target-language document by drawing statistics from related documents in a resource-rich language.
method_label: Next, we show that <i>cross-lingual latent semantic analysis</i> is similarly capable of extracting useful statistics for language modeling.
method_label: Neither technique requires explicit translation capabilities between the two languages!
result_label: We demonstrate significant reductions in both perplexity and word error rate on a Mandarin speech recognition task by using these techniques.

TITLE: Improving Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity with Shared Sentence Encoder for Low-resource Languages
ABSTRACT: background_label: Measuring the semantic similarity between two sentences (or Semantic Textual Similarity - STS) is fundamental in many NLP applications.
background_label: Despite the remarkable results in supervised settings with adequate labeling, little attention has been paid to this task in low-resource languages with insufficient labeling.
background_label: Existing approaches mostly leverage machine translation techniques to translate sentences into rich-resource language.
background_label: These approaches either beget language biases, or be impractical in industrial applications where spoken language scenario is more often and rigorous efficiency is required.
objective_label: In this work, we propose a multilingual framework to tackle the STS task in a low-resource language e.g.
method_label: Spanish, Arabic , Indonesian and Thai, by utilizing the rich annotation data in a rich resource language, e.g.
objective_label: English.
method_label: Our approach is extended from a basic monolingual STS framework to a shared multilingual encoder pretrained with translation task to incorporate rich-resource language data.
method_label: By exploiting the nature of a shared multilingual encoder, one sentence can have multiple representations for different target translation language, which are used in an ensemble model to improve similarity evaluation.
result_label: We demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state of the art approaches on SemEval STS task by its significant improvement on non-MT method, as well as an online industrial product where MT method fails to beat baseline while our approach still has consistently improvements.

TITLE: Estimation of statistical translation models based on mutual information for ad hoc information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: As a principled approach to capturing semantic relations of words in information retrieval, statistical translation models have been shown to outperform simple document language models which rely on exact matching of words in the query and documents.
background_label: A main challenge in applying translation models to ad hoc information retrieval is to estimate a translation model without training data.
background_label: Existing work has relied on training on synthetic queries generated based on a document collection.
background_label: However, this method is computationally expensive and does not have a good coverage of query words.
method_label: In this paper, we propose an alternative way to estimate a translation model based on normalized mutual information between words, which is less computationally expensive and has better coverage of query words than the synthetic query method of estimation.
method_label: We also propose to regularize estimated translation probabilities to ensure sufficient probability mass for self-translation.
result_label: Experiment results show that the proposed mutual information-based estimation method is not only more efficient, but also more effective than the synthetic query-based method, and it can be combined with pseudo-relevance feedback to further improve retrieval accuracy.
result_label: The results also show that the proposed regularization strategy is effective and can improve retrieval accuracy for both synthetic query-based estimation and mutual information-based estimation.

TITLE: Learning Semantics with Deep Belief Network for Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTThis paper introduces a cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) framework that combines the state-of-the-art keyword-based approach with a latent semantic-based retrieval model.
method_label: To capture and analyze the hidden semantics in cross-lingual settings, we construct latent semantic models that map text in different languages into a shared semantic space.
method_label: Our proposed framework consists of deep belief networks (DBN) for each language and we employ canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to construct a shared semantic space.
result_label: We evaluated the proposed CLIR approach on a standard ad hoc CLIR dataset, and we show that the cross-lingual semantic analysis with DBN and CCA improves the state-of-the-art keyword-based CLIR performance.

TITLE: Learning Neural Representation for CLIR with Adversarial Framework
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThe existing studies in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) mostly rely on general text representation models (e.g., vector space model or latent semantic analysis).
background_label: These models are not optimized for the target retrieval task.
method_label: In this paper, we follow the success of neural representation in natural language processing (NLP) and develop a novel text representation model based on adversarial learning, which seeks a task-specific embedding space for CLIR.
method_label: Adversarial learning is implemented as an interplay between the generator process and the discriminator process.
method_label: In order to adapt adversarial learning to CLIR, we design three constraints to direct representation learning, which are (1) a matching constraint capturing essential characteristics of cross-language ranking, (2) a translation constraint bridging language gaps, and (3) an adversarial constraint forcing both language and source invariant to be reached more efficiently and effectively.
result_label: Through the joint exploitation of these constraints in an adversarial manner, the underlying cross-language semantics relevant to retrieval tasks are better preserved in the embedding space.
result_label: Standard CLIR experiments show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continuous space models and approaches the strong machine translation and monolingual baselines.

TITLE: A Comparative Study of Query and Document Translation for Cross-language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: Cross-language retrieval systems use queries in one natural language to guide retrieval of documents that might be written in another.
background_label: Acquisition and representation of translation knowledge plays a central role in this process.
objective_label: This paper explores the utility o f t wo sources of translation knowledge for cross-language retrieval.
method_label: We h a ve implemented six query translation techniques that use bilingual term lists and one based on direct use of the translation output from an existing machine translation system these are compared with a document translation technique that uses output from the same machine translation system.
result_label: Average precision measures on a TREC collection suggest that arbitrarily selecting a single dictionary translation is typically no less e ective than using every translation in the dictionary, that query translation using a machine translation system can achieve somewhat better e ectiveness than simpler techniques, and that document translation may result in further improvements in retrieval e ectiveness under some conditions.

TITLE: A maximum coherence model for dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: One key to cross-language information retrieval is how to efficiently resolve the translation ambiguity of queries given their short length.
background_label: This problem is even more challenging when only bilingual dictionaries are available, which is the focus of this paper.
background_label: In the previous research of cross-language information retrieval using bilingual dictionaries, the word co-occurrence statistics is used to determine the most likely translations of queries.
method_label: In this paper, we propose a novel statistical model, named ``maximum coherence model'', which estimates the translation probabilities of query words that are consistent with the word co-occurrence statistics.
method_label: Unlike the previous work, where a binary decision is made for the selection of translations, the new model maintains the uncertainty in translating query words when their sense ambiguity is difficult to resolve.
method_label: Furthermore, this new model is able to estimate translations of multiple query words simultaneously.
method_label: This is in contrast to many previous approaches where translations of individual query words are determined independently.
result_label: Empirical studies with TREC datasets have shown that the maximum coherence model achieves a relative 10% - 40% improvement in cross-language information retrieval, comparing to other approaches that also use word co-occurrence statistics for sense disambiguation.

TITLE: Improving Cross Language Information Retrieval Using Corpus Based Query Suggestion Approach
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: Users seeking information may not find relevant information pertaining to their information need in a specific language.
background_label: But information may be available in a language different from their own, but users may not know that language.
background_label: Thus users may experience difficulty in accessing the information present in different languages.
background_label: Since the retrieval process depends on the translation of the user query, there are many issues in getting the right translation of the user query.
result_label: For a pair of languages chosen by a user, resources, like incomplete dictionary, inaccurate machine translation system may exist.
background_label: These resources may be insufficient to map the query terms in one language to its equivalent terms in another language.
background_label: Also for a given query, there might exist multiple correct translations.
background_label: The underlying corpus evidence may suggest a clue to select a probable set of translations that could eventually perform a better information retrieval.
objective_label: In this paper, we present a cross language information retrieval approach to effectively retrieve information present in a language other than the language of the user query using the corpus driven query suggestion approach.
method_label: The idea is to utilize the corpus based evidence of one language to improve the retrieval and re-ranking of news documents in the another language.
result_label: We use FIRE corpora -Tamil and English news collections -in our experiments and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed cross language information retrieval approach.

method_label: We investigate information retrieval between English and French, incorporating both translations directions into both document translation and query translation-based information retrieval, as well as into hybrid systems.
result_label: We find that hybrids of document and query translation-based systems out-perform query translation systems, even human-quality query translation systems.

TITLE: Extending query translation to cross-language query expansion with markov chain models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Dictionary-based approaches to query translation have been widely used in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) experiments.
background_label: However, translation has been not only limited by the coverage of the dictionary, but also affected by translation ambiguities.
objective_label: In this paper we propose a novel method of query translation that combines other types of term relation to complement the dictionary-based translation.
method_label: This allows extending the literal query translation to related words, which produce a beneficial effect of query expansion in CLIR.
method_label: In this paper, we model query translation by Markov Chains (MC), where query translation is viewed as a process of expanding query terms to their semantically similar terms in a different language.
method_label: In MC, terms and their relationships are modeled as a directed graph, and query translation is performed as a random walk in the graph, which propagates probabilities to related terms.
method_label: This framework allows us to incorporating different types of term relation, either between two languages or within the source or target languages.
method_label: In addition, the iterative training process of MC allows us to attribute higher probabilities to the target terms more related to the original query, thus offers a solution to the translation ambiguity problem.
result_label: We evaluated our method on three CLIR benchmark collections, and obtained significant improvements over traditional dictionary-based approaches.

TITLE: Disambiguation strategies for cross-language information retrieval
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
objective_label: This paper gives an overview of tools and methods for CrossLanguage Information Retrieval (CLIR) that are developed within the Twenty-One project.
method_label: The tools and methods are evaluated with the TREC CLIR task document collection using Dutch queries on the English document base.
objective_label: The main issue addressed here is an evaluation of two approaches to disambiguation.
method_label: The underlying question is whether a lot of effort should be put in finding the correct translation for each query term before searching, or whether searching with more than one possible translation leads to better results?
result_label: The experimental study suggests that the quality of search methods is more important than the quality of disambiguation methods.
result_label: Good retrieval methods are able to disambiguate translated queries implicitly during searching.

TITLE: UsingWord Embeddings for Query Translation for Hindi to English Cross Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) has become an important problem to solve in the recent years due to the growth of content in multiple languages in the Web.
background_label: One of the standard methods is to use query translation from source to target language.
method_label: In this paper, we propose an approach based on word embeddings, a method that captures contextual clues for a particular word in the source language and gives those words as translations that occur in a similar context in the target language.
method_label: Once we obtain the word embeddings of the source and target language pairs, we learn a projection from source to target word embeddings, making use of a dictionary with word translation pairs.We then propose various methods of query translation and aggregation.
method_label: The advantage of this approach is that it does not require the corpora to be aligned (which is difficult to obtain for resource-scarce languages), a dictionary with word translation pairs is enough to train the word vectors for translation.
method_label: We experiment with Forum for Information Retrieval and Evaluation (FIRE) 2008 and 2012 datasets for Hindi to English CLIR.
result_label: The proposed word embedding based approach outperforms the basic dictionary based approach by 70% and when the word embeddings are combined with the dictionary, the hybrid approach beats the baseline dictionary based method by 77%.
result_label: It outperforms the English monolingual baseline by 15%, when combined with the translations obtained from Google Translate and Dictionary.

TITLE: Exploiting proximity feature in statistical translation models for information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: A main challenge in applying translation language models to information retrieval is how to estimate the 'true' probability that a query could be generated as a translation of a document.
method_label: The state-of-art methods rely on document-based word co-occurrences to estimate word-word translation probabilities.
method_label: However, these methods do not take into account the proximity of co-occurrences.
method_label: Intuitively, the proximity of co-occurrences can be exploited to estimate more accurate translation probabilities, since two words occur closer are more likely to be related.
method_label: In this paper, we study how to explicitly incorporate proximity information into the existing translation language model, and propose a proximity-based translation language model, called TM-P, with three variants.
method_label: In our TM-P models, a new concept (proximity-based word co-occurrence frequency) is introduced to model the proximity of word co-occurrences, which is then used to estimate translation probabilities.
result_label: Experimental results on standard TREC collections show that our TM-P models achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art translation models.

TITLE: The Problem of Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: As the World Wide Web infiltrates more and more countries, banalizing network, interface, and computer system differences which have impeded information access, it becomes more common for non-native speakers to explore multilingual text collections.
background_label: Beyond merely accepting 8-bit accented characters, information retrieval systems should provide help in searching for information across language boundaries.
background_label: This situation has given rise to a new research area called Cross Language Information Retrieval, at the intersection of Machine Translation and Information Retrieval.
result_label: Though sharing some problems in both of these areas, Cross Language Information Retrieval poses specific problems, three of which are described in this chapter.

TITLE: Cross Language Information Retrieval using Multilingual Ontology as Translation and Query Expansion Base
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract —This paper reports an experiment to evaluate a Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) system that uses a multilingual ontology to improve query translation in the travel domain.
method_label: The ontology-based approach significantly outperformed the Machine Readable Dictionary translation baseline using Mean Average Precision as a metric in a user-centered experiment.
method_label: Index terms —Ontology, multilingual, cross language information retrieval.
background_label: I. I NTRODUCTION HE growing requirement on the Internet for users to access information expressed in language other than their own has led to Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) becoming established as a major topic in IR.
method_label: One approach to CLIR uses different translation approaches to translate queries to documents and indexes in other languages.
method_label: As queries submitted to search engines suffer lack of context, translation approaches have great problems with resolving query ambiguity.
method_label: In our approach, we built a multilingual ontology to be used as a translation base for CLIR.
result_label: In this paper we evaluate our proposed query translation methodology and compare it with a base line system that uses a Machine Readable Dictionary (MRD) as translation base in a user-centered experiment.

TITLE: Using structured queries for disambiguation in cross-language information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Bilingual transthr dictionaries are an important resource for query translation in cross-language text retrieval.
background_label: However, term translation is not an isomorphic process, so dictionary-based systems must address the problem of ambiguity in language translation.
objective_label: In this paper, we claim that boolea~l conjunction (the AND operator) provides siml)le and automatic disambiguation in the target language.
method_label: We derive a new weighted boolean model based on a probabilistic formulation a~l(l apply it to the crosslanguage text retriewd prol)lem.
result_label: The results suggest that the weighted boolean model is highly effective for general text retrieval, but more experimental evidence is need to conclude that it is particularly advantageous for cross-language application.
result_label: Nonetheless, the preliminary results are quite promising.

TITLE: A Maximum Likelihood Ratio Information Retrieval Model
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTIn this paper we present a novel probabilistic information retrieval model that scores documents based on the relative change in the document likelihoods, expressed as the ratio of the conditional probability of the document given the query and the prior probability of the document before the query is specified.
method_label: The document likelihoods are computed using statistical language modeling techniques and the model parameters are estimated automatically and dynamically for each query to optimize well-specified (maximum likelihood) objective functions.
method_label: We derive the basic retrieval model, describe the details of the model, and present some extensions to the model including a method to perform automatic feedback.
method_label: Development experiments are performed using the TREC-6 ad hoc text retrieval task and performance is measured using the TREC-7 ad hoc task.
result_label: Official evaluation results on the 1999 TREC-8 ad hoc task are also reported.
result_label: The performance results demonstrate that the model is competitive with current state-of-the-art retrieval approaches.

TITLE: Enhancing Translation Language Models with Word Embedding for Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we explore the usage of Word Embedding semantic resources for Information Retrieval (IR) task.
background_label: This embedding, produced by a shallow neural network, have been shown to catch semantic similarities between words (Mikolov et al., 2013).
objective_label: Hence, our goal is to enhance IR Language Models by addressing the term mismatch problem.
method_label: To do so, we applied the model presented in the paper Integrating and Evaluating Neural Word Embedding in Information Retrieval by Zuccon et al.
method_label: (2015) that proposes to estimate the translation probability of a Translation Language Model using the cosine similarity between Word Embedding.
result_label: The results we obtained so far did not show a statistically significant improvement compared to classical Language Model.

TITLE: Exploring Distributional Representations and Machine Translation for Aspect-based Cross-lingual Sentiment Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractCross-lingual sentiment classification (CLSC) seeks to use resources from a source language in order to detect sentiment and classify text in a target language.
background_label: Almost all research into CLSC has been carried out at sentence and document level, although this level of granularity is often less useful.
objective_label: This paper explores methods for performing aspect-based cross-lingual sentiment classification (aspect-based CLSC) for under-resourced languages.
method_label: Given the limited nature of parallel data for under-resourced languages, we would like to make the most of this resource for our task.
method_label: We compare zero-shot learning, bilingual word embeddings, stacked denoising autoencoder representations and machine translation techniques for aspect-based CLSC.
result_label: We show that models based on distributed semantics can achieve comparable results to machine translation on aspect-based CLSC.
result_label: Finally, we give an analysis of the errors found for each method.

TITLE: Resolving query translation ambiguity using a decaying co-occurrence model and syntactic dependence relations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Bilingual dictionaries have been commonly used for query translation in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
background_label: However, we are faced with the problem of translation selection.
background_label: Several recent studies suggested the utilization of term co-occurrences in this selection.
objective_label: This paper presents two extensions to improve them.
method_label: First, we extend the basic co-occurrence model by adding a decaying factor that decreases the mutual information when the distance between the terms increases.
method_label: Second, we incorporate a triple translation model, in which syntactic dependence relations (represented as triples) are integrated.
result_label: Our evaluation on translation accuracy shows that translating triples as units is more precise than a word-by-word translation.
result_label: Our CLIR experiments show that the addition of the decaying factor leads to substantial improvements of the basic co-occurrence model; and the triple translation model brings further improvements.

TITLE: Clickthrough-based translation models for web search: from word models to phrase models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Web search is challenging partly due to the fact that search queries and Web documents use different language styles and vocabularies.
objective_label: This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the language discrepancy issue, and explores the use of clickthrough data to bridge documents and queries.
method_label: We assume that a query is parallel to the titles of documents clicked on for that query.
method_label: Two translation models are trained and integrated into retrieval models: A word-based translation model that learns the translation probability between single words, and a phrase-based translation model that learns the translation probability between multi-term phrases.
method_label: Experiments are carried out on a real world data set.
result_label: The results show that the retrieval systems that use the translation models outperform significantly the systems that do not.
result_label: The paper also demonstrates that standard statistical machine translation techniques such as word alignment, bilingual phrase extraction, and phrase-based decoding, can be adapted for building a better Web document retrieval system.

TITLE: Patent Translation within the MOLTO project
ABSTRACT: background_label: MOLTO is an FP7 European project whose goal is to translate texts between multiple languages in real time with high quality.
background_label: Patents translation is a case of study where research is focused on simultaneously obtaining a large coverage without loosing quality in the translation.
method_label: This is achieved by hybridising between a grammar-based multilingual translation system, GF, and a specialised statistical machine translation system.
result_label: Moreover, both individual systems by themselves already represent a step forward in the translation of patents in the biomedical domain, for which the systems have been trained.

TITLE: Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval Models Based on (Bilingual) Word Embeddings
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose a new unified framework for monolingual (MoIR) and cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) which relies on the induction of dense real-valued word vectors known as word embeddings (WE) from comparable data.
method_label: To this end, we make several important contributions: (1) We present a novel word representation learning model called Bilingual Word Embeddings Skip-Gram (BWESG) which is the first model able to learn bilingual word embeddings solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data; (2) We demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to building document embeddings from single word embeddings by utilizing models from compositional distributional semantics.
result_label: BWESG induces a shared cross-lingual embedding vector space in which both words, queries, and documents may be presented as dense real-valued vectors; (3) We build novel ad-hoc MoIR and CLIR models which rely on the induced word and document embeddings and the shared cross-lingual embedding space; (4) Experiments for English and Dutch MoIR, as well as for English-to-Dutch and Dutch-to-English CLIR using benchmarking CLEF 2001-2003 collections and queries demonstrate the utility of our WE-based MoIR and CLIR models.
result_label: The best results on the CLEF collections are obtained by the combination of the WE-based approach and a unigram language model.
result_label: We also report on significant improvements in ad-hoc IR tasks of our WE-based framework over the state-of-the-art framework for learning text representations from comparable data based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

TITLE: Learning Translational and Knowledge-based Similarities from Relevance Rankings for Cross-Language Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present an approach to cross-language retrieval that combines dense knowledgebased features and sparse word translations.
background_label: Both feature types are learned directly from relevance rankings of bilingual documents in a pairwise ranking framework.
result_label: In large-scale experiments for patent prior art search and cross-lingual retrieval in Wikipedia, our approach yields considerable improvements over learningto-rank with either only dense or only sparse features, and over very competitive baselines that combine state-of-the-art machine translation and retrieval.

TITLE: Looking inside the box: context-sensitive translation for cross-language information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) today is dominated by techniques that use token-to-token mappings from bilingual dictionaries.
background_label: Yet, state-of-the-art statistical translation models (e.g., using Synchronous Context-Free Grammars) are far richer, capturing multi-term phrases, term dependencies, and contextual constraints on translation choice.
method_label: We present a novel CLIR framework that is able to reach inside the translation "black box" and exploit these sources of evidence.
result_label: Experiments on the TREC-5/6 English-Chinese test collection show this approach to be promising.

TITLE: Query Translation using Concepts Similarity based on Quran Ontology for Cross-Language Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTIn Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) process, the translation effects have a direct impact on the accuracy of follow-up retrieval results.
background_label: In dictionary-based approach, we are dealing with the words that have more than one meaning which can decrease the retrieval performance if the query translation return an incorrect translations.
background_label: These issues need to be overcome using efficient technique.
method_label: In this study we proposed a Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) method based on domain ontology using Quran concepts for disambiguating translation of the query and to improve the dictionary-based query translation.
method_label: For experimentation, we use Quran ontology written in English and Malay languages as a bilingual parallelcorpora and Quran concepts as a resource for cross-language query translation along with dictionary-based translation.
result_label: For evaluation, we measure the performance of three IR systems.
result_label: IR 1 is natural language query IR, IR 2 is natural language query CLIR based on dictionary (as a Baseline) and IR 3 is the retrieval of this research proposed method using Mean Average Precision (MAP) and average precision at 11 points of recall.
result_label: The experimental result shows that our proposed method brings significant improvement in retrieval accuracy for English document collections, but deficient for Malay document collections.
result_label: The proposed CLIR method can obtain query expansion effect and improve retrieval performance in certain language.

TITLE: Using Factored Word Representation in Neural Network Language Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractNeural network language and translation models have recently shown their great potentials in improving the performance of phrase-based machine translation.
background_label: At the same time, word representations using different word factors have been translation quality and are part of many state-of-theart machine translation systems.
objective_label: used in many state-of-the-art machine translation systems, in order to support better translation quality.In this work, we combined these two ideas by investigating the combination of both techniques.
method_label: By representing words in neural network language models using different factors, we were able to improve the models themselves as well as their impact on the overall machine translation performance.
method_label: This is especially helpful for morphologically rich languages due to their large vocabulary size.
method_label: Furthermore, it is easy to add additional knowledge, such as source side information, to the model.
result_label: Using this model we improved the translation quality of a state-of-the-art phrasebased machine translation system by 0.7 BLEU points.
result_label: We performed experiments on three language pairs for the news translation task of the WMT 2016 evaluation.

TITLE: Neural Network Models for Paraphrase Identification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural Language Inference, and Question Answering
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we analyze several neural network designs (and their variations) for sentence pair modeling and compare their performance extensively across eight datasets, including paraphrase identification, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference, and question answering tasks.
background_label: Although most of these models have claimed state-of-the-art performance, the original papers often reported on only one or two selected datasets.
result_label: We provide a systematic study and show that (i) encoding contextual information by LSTM and inter-sentence interactions are critical, (ii) Tree-LSTM does not help as much as previously claimed but surprisingly improves performance on Twitter datasets, (iii) the Enhanced Sequential Inference Model is the best so far for larger datasets, while the Pairwise Word Interaction Model achieves the best performance when less data is available.
result_label: We release our implementations as an open-source toolkit.

TITLE: LINSPECTOR: Multilingual Probing Tasks for Word Representations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Despite an ever growing number of word representation models introduced for a large number of languages, there is a lack of a standardized technique to provide insights into what is captured by these models.
background_label: Such insights would help the community to get an estimate of the downstream task performance, as well as to design more informed neural architectures, while avoiding extensive experimentation which requires substantial computational resources not all researchers have access to.
background_label: A recent development in NLP is to use simple classification tasks, also called probing tasks, that test for a single linguistic feature such as part-of-speech.
background_label: Existing studies mostly focus on exploring the information encoded by the sentence-level representations for English.
background_label: However, from a typological perspective the morphologically poor English is rather an outlier: the information encoded by the word order and function words in English is often stored on a subword, morphological level in other languages.
method_label: To address this, we introduce 15 word-level probing tasks such as case marking, possession, word length, morphological tag count and pseudoword identification for 24 languages.
method_label: We present experiments on several state of the art word embedding models, in which we relate the probing task performance for a diverse set of languages to a range of classic NLP tasks such as semantic role labeling and natural language inference.
result_label: We find that a number of probing tests have significantly high positive correlation to the downstream tasks, especially for morphologically rich languages.
result_label: We show that our tests can be used to explore word embeddings or black-box neural models for linguistic cues in a multilingual setting.
other_label: We release the probing datasets and the evaluation suite with https://github.com/UKPLab/linspector.

TITLE: Using Statistical Testing in the Evaluation of Retrieval Experiments
ABSTRACT: background_label: The standard strategies for evaluation based on precision and recall are examined and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
background_label: In particular, it is suggested that relevance feedback be evaluated from the perspective of the user.
background_label: A number of different statistical tests are described for determining if differences in performance between retrieval methods are significant.
background_label: These tests have often been ignored in the past because most are based on an assumption of normality which is not strictly valid for the standard performance measures.
result_label: However, one can test this assumption using simple diagnostic plots, and if it is a poor approximation, there are a number of non-parametric alternatives.

TITLE: Document-Level Machine Translation with Word Vector Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper we apply distributional semantic information to document-level machine translation.
method_label: We train monolingual and bilingual word vector models on large corpora and we evaluate them first in a cross-lingual lexical substitution task and then on the final translation task.
method_label: For translation, we incorporate the semantic information in a statistical document-level decoder (Docent), by enforcing translation choices that are semantically similar to the context.
method_label: As expected, the bilingual word vector models are more appropriate for the purpose of translation.
method_label: The final document-level translator incorporating the semantic model outperforms the basic Docent (without semantics) and also performs slightly over a standard sentencelevel SMT system in terms of ULC (the average of a set of standard automatic evaluation metrics for MT).
result_label: Finally, we also present some manual analysis of the translations of some concrete documents.

TITLE: Learning Hierarchical Translation Spans
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We propose a simple and effective approach to learn translation spans for the hierarchical phrase-based translation model.
method_label: Our model evaluates if a source span should be covered by translation rules during decoding, which is integrated into the translation system as soft constraints.
method_label: Compared to syntactic constraints, our model is directly acquired from an aligned parallel corpus and does not require parsers.
method_label: Rich source side contextual features and advanced machine learning methods were utilized for this learning task.
result_label: The proposed approach was evaluated on NTCIR-9 Chinese-English and Japanese-English translation tasks and showed significant improvement over the baseline system.

TITLE: A Word-to-Word Model of Translational Equivalence
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many multilingual NLP applications need to translate words between different languages, but cannot afford the computational expense of inducing or applying a full translation model.
method_label: For these applications, we have designed a fast algorithm for estimating a partial translation model, which accounts for translational equivalence only at the word level.
method_label: The model's precision/recall trade-off can be directly controlled via one threshold parameter.
method_label: This feature makes the model more suitable for applications that are not fully statistical.
method_label: The model's hidden parameters can be easily conditioned on information extrinsic to the model, providing an easy way to integrate pre-existing knowledge such as part-of-speech, dictionaries, word order, etc.. Our model can link word tokens in parallel texts as well as other translation models in the literature.
result_label: Unlike other translation models, it can automatically produce dictionary-sized translation lexicons, and it can do so with over 99% accuracy.

TITLE: Automated Phrase Mining from Massive Text Corpora
ABSTRACT: background_label: As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis, phrase mining aims at extracting quality phrases from a text corpus.
background_label: Phrase mining is important in various tasks such as information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction, and topic modeling.
background_label: Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption.
method_label: Recently, a few data-driven methods have been developed successfully for extraction of phrases from massive domain-specific text.
background_label: However, none of the state-of-the-art models is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or labeling phrases.
method_label: Since one can easily obtain many quality phrases from public knowledge bases to a scale that is much larger than that produced by human experts, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase, which leverages this large amount of high-quality phrases in an effective way and achieves better performance compared to limited human labeled phrases.
method_label: In addition, we develop a POS-guided phrasal segmentation model, which incorporates the shallow syntactic information in part-of-speech (POS) tags to further enhance the performance, when a POS tagger is available.
method_label: Note that, AutoPhrase can support any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not requiring, a POS tagger.
method_label: Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the new method has shown significant improvements in effectiveness on five real-world datasets across different domains and languages.

TITLE: An Open Source Toolkit for Word-level Confidence Estimation in Machine Translation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recently, a growing need of Confidence Estimation (CE) for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems in Computer Aided Translation (CAT), was observed.
background_label: However, most of the CE toolkits are optimized for a single target language (mainly English) and, as far as we know, none of them are dedicated to this specific task and freely available.
method_label: This paper presents an open-source toolkit for predicting the quality of words of a SMT output, whose novel contributions are (i) support for various target languages, (ii) handle a number of features of different types (system-based, lexical , syntactic and semantic).
method_label: In addition, the toolkit also integrates a wide variety of Natural Language Processing or Machine Learning tools to pre-process data, extract features and estimate confidence at word-level.
method_label: Features for Word-level Confidence Estimation (WCE) can be easily added / removed using a configuration file.
result_label: We validate the toolkit by experimenting in the WCE evaluation framework of WMT shared task with two language pairs: French-English and English-Spanish.
result_label: The toolkit is made available to the research community with ready-made scripts to launch full experiments on these language pairs, while achieving state-of-the-art and reproducible performances.

TITLE: Modeling Text with Graph Convolutional Network for Cross-Modal Information Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cross-modal information retrieval aims to find heterogeneous data of various modalities from a given query of one modality.
objective_label: The main challenge is to map different modalities into a common semantic space, in which distance between concepts in different modalities can be well modeled.
method_label: For cross-modal information retrieval between images and texts, existing work mostly uses off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction.
method_label: For texts, word-level features such as bag-of-words or word2vec are employed to build deep learning models to represent texts.
result_label: Besides word-level semantics, the semantic relations between words are also informative but less explored.
background_label: In this paper, we model texts by graphs using similarity measure based on word2vec.
objective_label: A dual-path neural network model is proposed for couple feature learning in cross-modal information retrieval.
method_label: One path utilizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for text modeling based on graph representations.
method_label: The other path uses a neural network with layers of nonlinearities for image modeling based on off-the-shelf features.
method_label: The model is trained by a pairwise similarity loss function to maximize the similarity of relevant text-image pairs and minimize the similarity of irrelevant pairs.
result_label: Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly, with 17% improvement on accuracy for the best case.

TITLE: Statistical Machine Translation with Local Language Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractPart-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements.
background_label: We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization.
method_label: We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair.
method_label: The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding.
method_label: Our approach is evaluated for Arabic-and Chinese-to-English translation.
result_label: We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.

TITLE: Learning deep structured semantic models for web search using clickthrough data
ABSTRACT: background_label: Latent semantic models, such as LSA, intend to map a query to its relevant documents at the semantic level where keyword-based matching often fails.
objective_label: In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them.
method_label: The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data.
method_label: To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks.
method_label: The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set.
result_label: Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.

TITLE: Consistent Translation using Discriminative Learning - A Translation Memory-inspired Approach
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractWe present a discriminative learning method to improve the consistency of translations in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems.
method_label: Our method is inspired by Translation Memory (TM) systems which are widely used by human translators in industrial settings.
method_label: We constrain the translation of an input sentence using the most similar 'translation example' retrieved from the TM.
method_label: Differently from previous research which used simple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints are imposed using discriminative learning to optimise the translation performance.
result_label: We observe that using this method can benefit the SMT system by not only producing consistent translations, but also improved translation outputs.
result_label: We report a 0.9 point improvement in terms of BLEU score on English-Chinese technical documents.

TITLE: WNtags: A Web-Based Tool For Image Labeling And Retrieval With Lexical Ontologies
ABSTRACT: background_label: Ever growing number of image documents available on the Internet continuously motivates research in better annotation models and more efficient retrieval methods.
background_label: Formal knowledge representation of objects and events in pictures, their interaction as well as context complexity becomes no longer an option for a quality image repository, but a necessity.
method_label: We present an ontology-based online image annotation tool WNtags and demonstrate its usefulness in several typical multimedia retrieval tasks using International Affective Picture System emotionally annotated image database.
method_label: WNtags is built around WordNet lexical ontology but considers Suggested Upper Merged Ontology as the preferred labeling formalism.
method_label: WNtags uses sets of weighted WordNet synsets as high-level image semantic descriptors and query matching is performed with word stemming and node distance metrics.
result_label: We also elaborate our near future plans to expand image content description with induced affect as in stimuli for research of human emotion and attention.

TITLE: Viewing stemming as recall enhancement
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractPrevious research on stemming has shown both positive and negative effects on retrieval performance.
objective_label: This paper describes an experiment in which several linguistic and non-linguistic stemmers are evaluated on a Dutch test collection.Experiments especially focus on the measurement of Recall.
result_label: Results show that linguistic stemming restricted to inflection yields a significant improvement over full linguistic and non-linguistic stemming, both in average Precision and R-Recall.
result_label: Best results are obtained with a linguistic stemmer which is enhanced with compound analysis.
result_label: This version has a significantly better Recall than a system without stemming, without a significant deterioration of Precision.

TITLE: Towards one-shot learning for rare-word translation with external experts
ABSTRACT: background_label: Neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly improved the quality of automatic translation models.
background_label: One of the main challenges in current systems is the translation of rare words.
objective_label: We present a generic approach to address this weakness by having external models annotate the training data as Experts, and control the model-expert interaction with a pointer network and reinforcement learning.
method_label: Our experiments using phrase-based models to simulate Experts to complement neural machine translation models show that the model can be trained to copy the annotations into the output consistently.
result_label: We demonstrate the benefit of our proposed framework in outof-domain translation scenarios with only lexical resources, improving more than 1.0 BLEU point in both translation directions English to Spanish and German to English

TITLE: Using cognates to align sentences in bilingual corpora
ABSTRACT: background_label: A pair of pressure sensing probe tubes are placed in the fan discharge of a turbofan engine, aft of the outlet guide vanes (OGVs) the tubes being circumferentially spaced by a fraction of the OGV pitch.
method_label: A comparing means receives both pressures sensed by the double-barrelled probes and aerodynamically actuates to automatically select the higher of the two pressures.
result_label: An accurate pressure indication representative of the mainstream pressure is therefore obtained despite the localized lower pressure turbulence area that may be caused by the presence of the upstream outlet guide vane(s).

TITLE: TFIDF, LSI and multi-word in information retrieval and text categorization
ABSTRACT: background_label: Text representation, which is a fundamental and necessary process for text-based intelligent information processing, includes the tasks of determining the index terms for documents and producing the numeric vectors corresponding to the documents.
objective_label: In this paper, multi-word, which is regarded as containing more contextual semantics than individual word and possessing the favorable statistical characteristics, is proposed as an alternative index terms in vector space model for text representation with theoretical support.
method_label: We investigate the traditional indexing methods as TF*IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) and LSI (latent semantic indexing) for comparative study.
method_label: The performances of TF*IDF, LSI and multi-word are examined on the tasks of text classification, which includes information retrieval (IR) and text categorization (TC), in Chinese and English document collection respectively.
method_label: We also attempt to tune the rescaling factor of LSI and observe its effectiveness in text classification.
result_label: The experimental results demonstrate that TF*IDF and multi-word are comparable when they are used for IR and TC and LSI is the poorest one of them.
result_label: Moreover, the rescaling factor of LSI has an insignificant influence on its effectiveness on text classification for both Chinese and English text classification.

TITLE: Translation via a Pivot Language Challenges Direct Translation in CLIR
ABSTRACT: background_label: An apparatus for severing the ends of a plurality of parallel optical fibers so that the endfaces thereof are relatively flat, are substantially perpendicular to the fiber axes and are relatively coplanar.
background_label: The fibers are bent over an arcuate surface and are slidably clamped between the flat surfaces of two pieces of rubbery material.
method_label: The clamp is urged by a spring in such a direction that the fibers are in tension.
method_label: After one fiber is scored and breaks, the clamp automatically slides along the remaining fibers until the clamping force on those fibers is sufficient to prevent further sliding.
result_label: The fibers are individually severed in this manner.

TITLE: Reranking machine translation hypotheses with structured and web-based language models
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we investigate the use of linguistically motivated and computationally efficient structured language models for reranking N-best hypotheses in a statistical machine translation system.
method_label: These language models, developed from constraint dependency grammar parses, tightly integrate knowledge of words, morphological and lexical features, and syntactic dependency constraints.
method_label: Two structured language models are applied for N-best rescoring, one is an almost-parsing language model, and the other utilizes more syntactic features by explicitly modeling syntactic dependencies between words.
method_label: We also investigate effective and efficient language modeling methods to use N-grams extracted from up to 1 teraword of web documents.
result_label: We apply all these language models for N-best re-ranking on the NIST and DARPA GALE program1 2006 and 2007 machine translation evaluation tasks and find that the combination of these language models increases the BLEU score up to 1.6% absolutely on blind test sets.

method_label: We built a baseline tracking system based on a language modeling approach.
method_label: This approach had proved to be powerful for the TREC adaptive filtering task and several other IR tasks.

TITLE: Document language models, query models, and risk minimization for information retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a framework for information retrieval that combines document models and query models using a probabilistic ranking function based on Bayesian decision theory.
method_label: The framework suggests an operational retrieval model that extends recent developments in the language modeling approach to information retrieval.
method_label: A language model for each document is estimated, as well as a language model for each query, and the retrieval problem is cast in terms of risk minimization.
method_label: The query language model can be exploited to model user preferences, the context of a query, synonomy and word senses.
method_label: While recent work has incorporated word translation models for this purpose, we introduce a new method using Markov chains defined on a set of documents to estimate the query models.
method_label: The Markov chain method has connections to algorithms from link analysis and social networks.
result_label: The new approach is evaluated on TREC collections and compared to the basic language modeling approach and vector space models together with query expansion using Rocchio.
result_label: Significant improvements are obtained over standard query expansion methods for strong baseline TF-IDF systems, with the greatest improvements attained for short queries on Web data.

TITLE: Introducing the Autshumato Integrated Translation Environment
ABSTRACT: background_label: Translation is an indispensable process for socioeconomic and cultural development in a multilingual society.
background_label: The use of translation tools such as translation memories and machine translation systems can be beneficial in supporting the human translator.
background_label: Unfortunately, the availability of these tools is limited for resource-scarce languages.
objective_label: In this paper, we introduce the Autshumato Integrated Translation Environment that facilitates a comprehensive set of translation tools, including machine translation and translation memory.
method_label: The Autshumato Integrated Translation Environment is specifically developed for translation between the official South African languages, but it is in essence languageindependent and can therefore be used to translate between any language pair.

TITLE: Multilingual Neural Machine Translation with Task-Specific Attention
ABSTRACT: background_label: Multilingual machine translation addresses the task of translating between multiple source and target languages.
objective_label: We propose task-specific attention models, a simple but effective technique for improving the quality of sequence-to-sequence neural multilingual translation.
objective_label: Our approach seeks to retain as much of the parameter sharing generalization of NMT models as possible, while still allowing for language-specific specialization of the attention model to a particular language-pair or task.
method_label: Our experiments on four languages of the Europarl corpus show that using a target-specific model of attention provides consistent gains in translation quality for all possible translation directions, compared to a model in which all parameters are shared.
result_label: We observe improved translation quality even in the (extreme) low-resource zero-shot translation directions for which the model never saw explicitly paired parallel data.

TITLE: Relevance based language models
ABSTRACT: background_label: We explore the relation between classical probabilistic models of information retrieval and the emerging language modeling approaches.
background_label: It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate arelevance model: probabilities of words in the relevant class.
method_label: We propose a novel technique for estimating these probabilities using the query alone.
method_label: We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy.
result_label: Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks.
result_label: The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.

TITLE: TransSearch: from a bilingual concordancer to a translation finder
ABSTRACT: background_label: As basic as bilingual concordancers may appear, they are some of the most widely used computer-assisted translation tools among professional translators.
background_label: Nevertheless, they still do not benefit from recent breakthroughs in machine translation.
objective_label: This paper describes the improvement of the commercial bilingual concordancer TransSearch in order to embed a word alignment feature.
method_label: The use of statistical word alignment methods allows the system to spot user query translations, and thus the tool is transformed into a translation search engine.
method_label: We describe several translation identification and postprocessing algorithms that enhance the application.
result_label: The excellent results obtained using a large translation memory consisting of 8.3 million sentence pairs are confirmed via human evaluation.

TITLE: How Grammatical is Character-level Neural Machine Translation? Assessing MT Quality with Contrastive Translation Pairs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Analysing translation quality in regards to specific linguistic phenomena has historically been difficult and time-consuming.
objective_label: Neural machine translation has the attractive property that it can produce scores for arbitrary translations, and we propose a novel method to assess how well NMT systems model specific linguistic phenomena such as agreement over long distances, the production of novel words, and the faithful translation of polarity.
method_label: The core idea is that we measure whether a reference translation is more probable under a NMT model than a contrastive translation which introduces a specific type of error.
method_label: We present LingEval97, a large-scale data set of 97000 contrastive translation pairs based on the WMT English->German translation task, with errors automatically created with simple rules.
result_label: We report results for a number of systems, and find that recently introduced character-level NMT systems perform better at transliteration than models with byte-pair encoding (BPE) segmentation, but perform more poorly at morphosyntactic agreement, and translating discontiguous units of meaning.

TITLE: Neural-based machine translation for medical text domain. Based on European Medicines Agency leaflet texts
ABSTRACT: background_label: The quality of machine translation is rapidly evolving.
background_label: Today one can find several machine translation systems on the web that provide reasonable translations, although the systems are not perfect.
background_label: In some specific domains, the quality may decrease.
objective_label: A recently proposed approach to this domain is neural machine translation.
objective_label: It aims at building a jointly-tuned single neural network that maximizes translation performance, a very different approach from traditional statistical machine translation.
method_label: Recently proposed neural machine translation models often belong to the encoder-decoder family in which a source sentence is encoded into a fixed length vector that is, in turn, decoded to generate a translation.
method_label: The present research examines the effects of different training methods on a Polish-English Machine Translation system used for medical data.
method_label: The European Medicines Agency parallel text corpus was used as the basis for training of neural and statistical network-based translation systems.
method_label: The main machine translation evaluation metrics have also been used in analysis of the systems.
result_label: A comparison and implementation of a real-time medical translator is the main focus of our experiments.

TITLE: The Qanary Ecosystem: Getting New Insights by Composing Question Answering Pipelines
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: The field of Question Answering (QA) is very multi-disciplinary as it requires expertise from a large number of areas such as natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence, machine learning, information retrieval, speech recognition and semantic technologies.
background_label: In the past years a large number of QA systems were proposed using approaches from different fields and focusing on particular tasks in the QA process.
background_label: Unfortunately, most of these systems cannot be easily reused, extended, and results cannot be easily reproduced since the systems are mostly implemented in a monolithic fashion, lack standardized interfaces and are often not open source or available as Web services.
method_label: To address these issues we developed the knowledge-based Qanary methodology for choreographing QA pipelines distributed over the Web.
method_label: Qanary employs the qa vocabulary as an exchange format for typical QA components.
background_label: As a result, QA systems can be built using the Qanary methodology in a simpler, more flexible and standardized way while becoming knowledgedriven instead of being process-oriented.
objective_label: This paper presents the components and services that are integrated using the qa vocabulary and the Qanary methodology within the Qanary ecosystem.
method_label: Moreover, we show how the Qanary ecosystem can be used to analyse QA processes to detect weaknesses and research gaps.
method_label: We illustrate this by focusing on the Entity Linking (EL) task w.r.t.
method_label: textual natural language input, which is a fundamental step in most QA processes.
method_label: Additionally, we contribute the first EL benchmark for QA, as open source.
result_label: Our main goal is to show how the research community can use Qanary to gain new insights into QA processes.

TITLE: Normalising orthographic and dialectal variants for the automatic processing of Swiss German
ABSTRACT: background_label: Swiss dialects of German are, unlike most dialects of well standardised languages, widely used in everyday communication.
background_label: Despite this fact, they lack tools and resources for natural language processing.
background_label: The main reason for this is the fact that the dialects are mostly spoken and that written resources are small and highly inconsistent.
objective_label: This paper addresses the great variability in writing that poses a problem for automatic processing.
objective_label: We propose an automatic approach to normalising the variants to a single representation intended for processing tools’ internal use (not shown to human users).
method_label: We manually create a sample of transcribed and normalised texts, which we use to train and test three methods based on machine translation: word-by-word mappings, character-based machine translation, and language modelling.
result_label: We show that an optimal combination of the three approaches gives better results than any of them separately.

TITLE: Investigations on Translation Model Adaptation Using Monolingual Data
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractMost of the freely available parallel data to train the translation model of a statistical machine translation system comes from very specific sources (European parliament, United Nations, etc).
background_label: Therefore, there is increasing interest in methods to perform an adaptation of the translation model.
background_label: A popular approach is based on unsupervised training, also called self-enhancing.
method_label: Both only use monolingual data to adapt the translation model.
method_label: In this paper we extend the previous work and provide new insight in the existing methods.
result_label: We report results on the translation between French and English.
result_label: Improvements of up to 0.5 BLEU were observed with respect to a very competitive baseline trained on more than 280M words of human translated parallel data.

TITLE: GRU based Named Entity Recognition System for Bangla Online Newspapers
ABSTRACT: background_label: Information Extraction (IE) from textual documents locates important entities and their underlying connections using automated systems which are crucial to different applications including Data Mining (DM), Question Answering (QA), Machine Translation (MT) and so on.
background_label: Named Entity Recognition (NER) being a sub-component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an IE task which aims at locating the textual presence of entities belonging to a prescribed set of classes.
background_label: Due to its political and geographical influence, Bangla language is widely spoken around the globe and it is important to enrich its linguistic knowledge through NLP tools where NER is a common pre- processing step.
method_label: The expeditiously growing World Wide Web (WWW) containing Bangla textual documents is in a formative stage with the proliferation of Bangla online newspapers and researchers have applied traditional classic learning algorithms for Bangla NER task while few researchers have used hand- crafted rules.
method_label: Technological improvements show that with the capability of Deep Learning technique, NER performance can be boosted and hence this work is an effort to apply a variation of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN); especially a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model for developing a Bangla NER task with a manually annotated dataset.
result_label: The evaluation of our experimental results discovers how our approach can perform better when applied on a large scale dataset.

TITLE: Towards Recognizing Phrase Translation Processes: Experiments on English-French
ABSTRACT: background_label: When translating phrases (words or group of words), human translators, consciously or not, resort to different translation processes apart from the literal translation, such as Idiom Equivalence, Generalization, Particularization, Semantic Modulation, etc.
background_label: Translators and linguists (such as Vinay and Darbelnet, Newmark, etc.)
background_label: have proposed several typologies to characterize the different translation processes.
background_label: However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been effort to automatically classify these fine-grained translation processes.
method_label: Recently, an English-French parallel corpus of TED Talks has been manually annotated with translation process categories, along with established annotation guidelines.
method_label: Based on these annotated examples, we propose an automatic classification of translation processes at subsentential level.
result_label: Experimental results show that we can distinguish non-literal translation from literal translation with an accuracy of 87.09%, and 55.20% for classifying among five non-literal translation processes.
result_label: This work demonstrates that it is possible to automatically classify translation processes.
result_label: Even with a small amount of annotated examples, our experiments show the directions that we can follow in future work.
result_label: One of our long term objectives is leveraging this automatic classification to better control paraphrase extraction from bilingual parallel corpora.

TITLE: Crowdsourced Monolingual Translation
ABSTRACT: background_label: An enormous potential exists for solving certain classes of computational problems through rich collaboration among crowds of humans supported by computers.
background_label: Solutions to these problems used to involve human professionals, who are expensive to hire or difficult to find.
background_label: Despite significant advances, fully automatic systems still have much room for improvement.
background_label: Recent research has involved recruiting large crowds of skilled humans (“crowdsourcing”), but crowdsourcing solutions are still restricted by the availability of those skilled human participants.
background_label: With translation, for example, professional translators incur a high cost and are not always available; machine translation systems have been greatly improved recently but still can only provide passable translation; and crowdsourced translation is limited by the availability of bilingual humans.
objective_label: This article describes crowdsourced monolingual translation, where monolingual translation is translation performed by monolingual people.
method_label: Crowdsourced monolingual translation is a collaborative form of translation performed by two crowds of people who speak the source or the target language, respectively, with machine translation as the mediating device.
method_label: This article describes a general protocol to handle crowdsourced monolingual translation and analyzes three systems that implemented the protocol.
method_label: These systems were studied in various settings and were found to supply significant improvement in quality over both machine translation and monolingual editing of machine translation output (“postediting”).

TITLE: A passage retrieval method based on probabilistic information retrieval model and UMLS concepts in biomedical question answering.
ABSTRACT: background_label: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Passage retrieval, the identification of top-ranked passages that may contain the answer for a given biomedical question, is a crucial component for any biomedical question answering (QA) system.
background_label: Passage retrieval in open-domain QA is a longstanding challenge widely studied over the last decades.
background_label: However, it still requires further efforts in biomedical QA.
method_label: In this paper, we present a new biomedical passage retrieval method based on Stanford CoreNLP sentence/passage length, probabilistic information retrieval (IR) model and UMLS concepts.
method_label: METHODS In the proposed method, we first use our document retrieval system based on PubMed search engine and UMLS similarity to retrieve relevant documents to a given biomedical question.
method_label: We then take the abstracts from the retrieved documents and use Stanford CoreNLP for sentence splitter to make a set of sentences, i.e., candidate passages.
method_label: Using stemmed words and UMLS concepts as features for the BM25 model, we finally compute the similarity scores between the biomedical question and each of the candidate passages and keep the N top-ranked ones.
result_label: RESULTS Experimental evaluations performed on large standard datasets, provided by the BioASQ challenge, show that the proposed method achieves good performances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods.
result_label: The proposed method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.84% in terms of mean average precision (MAP).
result_label: CONCLUSION We have proposed an efficient passage retrieval method which can be used to retrieve relevant passages in biomedical QA systems with high mean average precision.
