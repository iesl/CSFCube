TITLE: And That's A Fact: Distinguishing Factual and Emotional Argumentation in Online Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: We investigate the characteristics of factual and emotional argumentation styles observed in online debates.
method_label: Using an annotated set of"factual"and"feeling"debate forum posts, we extract patterns that are highly correlated with factual and emotional arguments, and then apply a bootstrapping methodology to find new patterns in a larger pool of unannotated forum posts.
method_label: This process automatically produces a large set of patterns representing linguistic expressions that are highly correlated with factual and emotional language.
result_label: Finally, we analyze the most discriminating patterns to better understand the defining characteristics of factual and emotional arguments.

TITLE: Learning Extraction Patterns For Subjective Expressions
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents a bootstrapping process that learns linguistically rich extraction patterns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.
method_label: High-precision classifiers label unannotated data to automatically create a large training set, which is then given to an extraction pattern learning algorithm.
method_label: The learned patterns are then used to identify more subjective sentences.
method_label: The bootstrapping process learns many subjective patterns and increases recall while maintaining high precision.

TITLE: Creating and Characterizing a Diverse Corpus of Sarcasm in Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: The use of irony and sarcasm in social media allows us to study them at scale for the first time.
background_label: However, their diversity has made it difficult to construct a high-quality corpus of sarcasm in dialogue.
method_label: Here, we describe the process of creating a large- scale, highly-diverse corpus of online debate forums dialogue, and our novel methods for operationalizing classes of sarcasm in the form of rhetorical questions and hyperbole.
method_label: We show that we can use lexico-syntactic cues to reliably retrieve sarcastic utterances with high accuracy.
method_label: To demonstrate the properties and quality of our corpus, we conduct supervised learning experiments with simple features, and show that we achieve both higher precision and F than previous work on sarcasm in debate forums dialogue.
method_label: We apply a weakly-supervised linguistic pattern learner and qualitatively analyze the linguistic differences in each class.

TITLE: Identifying Subjective and Figurative Language in Online Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: More and more of the information on the web is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum conversations, to comment threads on news articles.
background_label: In contrast to traditional, monologic resources such as news, highly social dialogue is very frequent in social media.
method_label: We aim to automatically identify sarcastic and nasty utterances in unannotated online dialogue, extending a bootstrapping method previously applied to the classification of monologic subjective sentences in Riloff and Weibe 2003.
method_label: We have adapted the method to fit the sarcastic and nasty dialogic domain.
result_label: Our method is as follows: 1) Explore methods for identifying sarcastic and nasty cue words and phrases in dialogues; 2) Use the learned cues to train a sarcastic (nasty) Cue-Based Classifier; 3) Learn general syntactic extraction patterns from the sarcastic (nasty) utterances and define fine-tuned sarcastic patterns to create a Pattern-Based Classifier; 4) Combine both Cue-Based and fine-tuned Pattern-Based Classifiers to maximize precision at the expense of recall and test on unannotated utterances.

TITLE: Exploiting a Bootstrapping Approach for Automatic Annotation of Emotions in Texts
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The objective of this research is to develop a technique to automatically annotate emotional corpora.
background_label: The complexity of automatic annotation of emotional corpora still presents numerous challenges and thus there is a need to develop a technique that allow us to tackle the annotation task.
background_label: The relevance of this research is demonstrated by the fact that people's emotions and the patterns of these emotions provide a great value for business, individuals, society or politics.
background_label: Hence, the creation of a robust emotion detection system becomes crucial.
background_label: Due to the subjectivity of the emotions, the main challenge for the creation of emotional resources is the annotation process.
objective_label: Thus, with this staring point in mind, the objective of our paper is to illustrate an innovative and effective bootstrapping process for automatic annotations of emotional corpora.
result_label: The evaluations carried out confirm the soundness of the proposed approach and allow us to consider the bootstrapping process as an appropriate approach to create resources such as an emotional corpus that can be employed on supervised machine learning towards the improvement of emotion detection systems.

TITLE: Bootstrapped Learning of Emotion Hashtags #hashtags4you
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe present a bootstrapping algorithm to automatically learn hashtags that convey emotion.
method_label: Using the bootstrapping framework, we learn lists of emotion hashtags from unlabeled tweets.
method_label: Our approach starts with a small number of seed hashtags for each emotion, which we use to automatically label tweets as initial training data.
method_label: We then train emotion classifiers and use them to identify and score candidate emotion hashtags.
method_label: We select the hashtags with the highest scores, use them to automatically harvest new tweets from Twitter, and repeat the bootstrapping process.
result_label: We show that the learned hashtag lists help to improve emotion classification performance compared to an N-gram classifier, obtaining 8% microaverage and 9% macro-average improvements in F-measure.

TITLE: Annotating Argument Components and Relations in Persuasive Essays
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractIn this paper, we present a novel approach to model arguments, their components and relations in persuasive essays in English.
method_label: We propose an annotation scheme that includes the annotation of claims and premises as well as support and attack relations for capturing the structure of argumentative discourse.
method_label: We further conduct a manual annotation study with three annotators on 90 persuasive essays.
result_label: The obtained inter-rater agreement of α U = 0.72 for argument components and α = 0.81 for argumentative relations indicates that the proposed annotation scheme successfully guides annotators to substantial agreement.
result_label: The final corpus and the annotation guidelines are freely available to encourage future research in argument recognition.

TITLE: Sarcasm as Contrast between a Positive Sentiment and Negative Situation
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractA common form of sarcasm on Twitter consists of a positive sentiment contrasted with a negative situation.
background_label: For example, many sarcastic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as "love" or "enjoy", followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., "taking exams" or "being ignored").
objective_label: We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to identify this type of sarcasm in tweets.
method_label: We present a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets.
result_label: We show that identifying contrasting contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sarcasm recognition.

TITLE: Really? Well. Apparently Bootstrapping Improves the Performance of Sarcasm and Nastiness Classifiers for Online Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: More and more of the information on the web is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum conversations, to comment threads on news articles.
background_label: In contrast to traditional, monologic Natural Language Processing resources such as news, highly social dialogue is frequent in social media, making it a challenging context for NLP.
method_label: This paper tests a bootstrapping method, originally proposed in a monologic domain, to train classifiers to identify two different types of subjective language in dialogue: sarcasm and nastiness.
method_label: We explore two methods of developing linguistic indicators to be used in a first level classifier aimed at maximizing precision at the expense of recall.
method_label: The best performing classifier for the first phase achieves 54% precision and 38% recall for sarcastic utterances.
method_label: We then use general syntactic patterns from previous work to create more general sarcasm indicators, improving precision to 62% and recall to 52%.
method_label: To further test the generality of the method, we then apply it to bootstrapping a classifier for nastiness dialogic acts.
result_label: Our first phase, using crowdsourced nasty indicators, achieves 58% precision and 49% recall, which increases to 75% precision and 62% recall when we bootstrap over the first level with generalized syntactic patterns.

TITLE: Visual Analysis of Conflicting Opinions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Understanding the nature and dynamics of conflicting opinions is a profound and challenging issue.
objective_label: In this paper we address several aspects of the issue through a study of more than 3,000 Amazon customer reviews of the controversial bestseller The Da Vinci Code, including 1,738 positive and 918 negative reviews.
objective_label: The study is motivated by critical questions such as: what are the differences between positive and negative reviews?
objective_label: What is the origin of a particular opinion?
method_label: How do these opinions change over time?
result_label: To what extent can differentiating features be identified from unstructured text?
background_label: How accurately can these features predict the category of a review?
method_label: We first analyze terminology variations in these reviews in terms of syntactic, semantic, and statistic associations identified by TermWatch and use term variation patterns to depict underlying topics.
method_label: We then select the most predictive terms based on log likelihood tests and demonstrate that this small set of terms classifies over 70% of the conflicting reviews correctly.
method_label: This feature selection process reduces the dimensionality of the feature space from more than 20,000 dimensions to a couple of hundreds.
method_label: We utilize automatically generated decision trees to facilitate the understanding of conflicting opinions in terms of these highly predictive terms.
result_label: This study also uses a number of visualization and modeling tools to identify not only what positive and negative reviews have in common, but also they differ and evolve over time

TITLE: Collaboration amidst disagreement and moral judgment: The dynamics of Jewish and Arab students’ collaborative inquiry of their joint past
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present an instructional model involving a computer-supported collaborative learning environment, in which students from two conflicting groups collaboratively investigate an event relevant to their past using historical texts.
background_label: We traced one enactment of the model by a group comprised of two Israeli Jewish and two Israeli Arab students.
method_label: Our data sources included the texts participants wrote—pre-, post- and during the activity, jointly and individually—the transcripts of the e-discussion and reflections written after the activity.
method_label: The setting enabled us to further our understanding of what collaboration means when students’ voices do not converge.
method_label: We examined whether the activity was productive in terms of learning, and the dynamics of collaboration within the milieu, especially the intersubjective meaning making.
method_label: The e-discussion that was co-constructed by participants was a chain of disagreements.
result_label: However, participants’ reflections reveal that the group structure and the e-communication method were perceived as affording sensitive collaboration.
result_label: Furthermore, a comparison between the individual texts, pre- and post- the group discussion, revealed that the activity was productive, since students moved from a one-sided presentation of the event to a more multi-sided representation.
result_label: Based on the analysis of the e-discussion, we conclude that the setting provided students with opportunities to examine their voices in light of alternatives.
result_label: We propose the term fission to articulate certain moments of intersubjectivity, where a crack is formed in one’s voice as the Other’s voice impacts it, and one’s voice become more polyphonic.

TITLE: Analyzing and learning the language for different types of harassment
ABSTRACT: background_label: Disclaimer: This paper is concerned with violent online harassment.
background_label: To describe the subject at an adequate level of realism, examples of our collected tweets involve violent, threatening, vulgar and hateful speech language in the context of racial, sexual, political, appearance and intellectual harassment.
background_label: The presence of a significant amount of harassment in user-generated content and its negative impact calls for robust automatic detection approaches.
method_label: This requires that we can identify different forms or types of harassment.
method_label: Earlier work has classified harassing language in terms of hurtfulness, abusiveness, sentiment, and profanity.
result_label: However, to identify and understand harassment more accurately, it is essential to determine the context that represents the interrelated conditions in which they occur.
background_label: In this paper, we introduce the notion of contextual type to harassment involving five categories: (i) sexual, (ii) racial, (iii) appearance-related, (iv) intellectual and (v) political.
method_label: We utilize an annotated corpus from Twitter distinguishing these types of harassment.
method_label: To study the context for each type that sheds light on the linguistic meaning, interpretation, and distribution, we conduct two lines of investigation: an extensive linguistic analysis, and a statistical distribution of unigrams.
method_label: We then build type-ware classifiers to automate the identification of type-specific harassment.
result_label: Our experiments demonstrate that these classifiers provide competitive accuracy for identifying and analyzing harassment on social media.
result_label: We present extensive discussion and major observations about the effectiveness of type-aware classifiers using a detailed comparison setup providing insight into the role of type-dependent features.

TITLE: Portable Features for Classifying Emotional Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractAre word-level affect lexicons useful in detecting emotions at sentence level?
background_label: Some prior research finds no gain over and above what is obtained with ngram features-arguably the most widely used features in text classification.
method_label: Here, we experiment with two very different emotion lexicons and show that even in supervised settings, an affect lexicon can provide significant gains.
method_label: We further show that while ngram features tend to be accurate, they are often unsuitable for use in new domains.
result_label: On the other hand, affect lexicon features tend to generalize and produce better results than ngrams when applied to a new domain.

TITLE: Towards segment-based recognition of argumentation structure in short texts
ABSTRACT: background_label: Despite recent advances in discourse parsing and causality detection, the automatic recognition of argumentation structure of authentic texts is still a very challenging task.
method_label: To approach this problem, we collected a small corpus of German microtexts in a text generation experiment, resulting in texts that are authentic but of controlled linguistic and rhetoric complexity.
method_label: We show that trained annotators can determine the argumentation structure on these microtexts reliably.
method_label: We experiment with different machine learning approaches for automatic argumentation structure recognition on various levels of granularity of the scheme.
result_label: Given the complex nature of such a discourse understanding tasks, the first results presented here are promising, but invite for further investigation.

TITLE: Identifying Justifications in Written Dialogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: In written dialog, discourse participants need to justify claims they make, to convince the reader the claim is true and/or relevant to the discourse.
objective_label: This paper presents a new task (with an associated corpus), namely detecting such justifications.
objective_label: We investigate the nature of such justifications, and observe that the justifications themselves often contain discourse structure.
method_label: We therefore develop a method to detect the existence of certain types of discourse relations, which helps us classify whether a segment is a justification or not.
method_label: Our task is novel, and our work is novel in that it uses a large set of connectives (which we call indicators), and in that it uses a large set of discourse relations, without choosing among them.

TITLE: Using Summarization to Discover Argument Facets in Online Ideological Dialog
ABSTRACT: background_label: More and more of the information available on the web is dialogic, and a significant portion of it takes place in online forum conversations about current social and political topics.
objective_label: We aim to develop tools to summarize what these conversations are about.
objective_label: What are the CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS associated with different stances on an issue, what are the abstract objects under discussion that are central to a speaker's argument?
objective_label: How can we recognize that two CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS realize the same FACET of the argument?
method_label: We hypothesize that the CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS are exactly those arguments that people find most salient, and use human summarization as a probe for discovering them.
method_label: We describe our corpus of human summaries of opinionated dialogs, then show how we can identify similar repeated arguments, and group them into FACETS across many discussions of a topic.
result_label: We define a new task, ARGUMENT FACET SIMILARITY (AFS), and show that we can predict AFS with a .54 correlation score, versus an ngram system baseline of .39 and a semantic textual similarity system baseline of .45.

TITLE: PEARL: An interactive visual analytic tool for understanding personal emotion style derived from social media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Hundreds of millions of people leave digital footprints on social media (e.g., Twitter and Facebook).
background_label: Such data not only disclose a person's demographics and opinions, but also reveal one's emotional style.
background_label: Emotional style captures a person's patterns of emotions over time, including his overall emotional volatility and resilience.
background_label: Understanding one's emotional style can provide great benefits for both individuals and businesses alike, including the support of self-reflection and delivery of individualized customer care.
method_label: We present PEARL, a timeline-based visual analytic tool that allows users to interactively discover and examine a person's emotional style derived from this person's social media text.
background_label: Compared to other visual text analytic systems, our work offers three unique contributions.
method_label: First, it supports multi-dimensional emotion analysis from social media text to automatically detect a person's expressed emotions at different time points and summarize those emotions to reveal the person's emotional style.
method_label: Second, it effectively visualizes complex, multi-dimensional emotion analysis results to create a visual emotional profile of an individual, which helps users browse and interpret one's emotional style.
method_label: Third, it supports rich visual interactions that allow users to interactively explore and validate emotion analysis results.
method_label: We have evaluated our work extensively through a series of studies.
result_label: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool both in emotion analysis from social media and in support of interactive visualization of the emotion analysis results.

TITLE: Identifying High-Level Organizational Elements in Argumentative Discourse
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractArgumentative discourse contains not only language expressing claims and evidence, but also language used to organize these claims and pieces of evidence.
background_label: Differentiating between the two may be useful for many applications, such as those that focus on the content (e.g., relation extraction) of arguments and those that focus on the structure of arguments (e.g., automated essay scoring).
method_label: We propose an automated approach to detecting high-level organizational elements in argumentative discourse that combines a rule-based system and a probabilistic sequence model in a principled manner.
result_label: We present quantitative results on a dataset of human-annotated persuasive essays, and qualitative analyses of performance on essays and on political debates.

TITLE: What makes a convincing argument? Empirical analysis and detecting attributes of convincingness in Web argumentation
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article tackles a new challenging task in computational argumentation.
objective_label: Given a pair of two arguments to a certain controversial topic, we aim to directly assess qualitative properties of the arguments in order to explain why one argument is more convincing than the other one.
method_label: We approach this task in a fully empirical manner by annotating 26k explanations written in natural language.
method_label: These explanations describe convincingness of arguments in the given argument pair, such as their strengths or flaws.
method_label: We create a new crowd-sourced corpus containing 9,111 argument pairs, multi-labeled with 17 classes, which was cleaned and curated by employing several strict quality measures.
method_label: We propose two tasks on this data set, namely (1) predicting the full label distribution and (2) classifying types of flaws in less convincing arguments.
result_label: Our experiments with feature-rich SVM learners and Bidirectional LSTM neural networks with convolution and attention mechanism reveal that such a novel fine-grained analysis of Web argument convincingness is a very challenging task.
result_label: We release the new UKPConvArg2 corpus and software under permissive licenses to the research community.

TITLE: Applying Argumentation Schemes for Essay Scoring
ABSTRACT: background_label: Under the framework of the argumentation scheme theory (Walton, 1996), we developed annotation protocols for an argumentative writing task to support identification and classification of the arguments being made in essays.
method_label: Each annotation protocol defined argumentation schemes (i.e., reasoning patterns) in a given writing prompt and listed questions to help evaluate an argument based on these schemes, to make the argument structure in a text explicit and classifiable.
result_label: We report findings based on an annotation of 600 essays.
result_label: Most annotation categories were applied reliably by human annotators, and some categories significantly contributed to essay score.
result_label: An NLP system to identify sentences containing scheme-relevant critical questions was developed based on the human annotations.

TITLE: In the eye of the beholder: employing statistical analysis and eye tracking for analyzing abstract paintings
ABSTRACT: background_label: Most artworks are explicitly created to evoke a strong emotional response.
background_label: During the centuries there were several art movements which employed different techniques to achieve emotional expressions conveyed by artworks.
background_label: Yet people were always consistently able to read the emotional messages even from the most abstract paintings.
background_label: Can a machine learn what makes an artwork emotional?
method_label: In this work, we consider a set of 500 abstract paintings from Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto (MART), where each painting was scored as carrying a positive or negative response on a Likert scale of 1-7.
method_label: We employ a state-of-the-art recognition system to learn which statistical patterns are associated with positive and negative emotions.
method_label: Additionally, we dissect the classification machinery to determine which parts of an image evokes what emotions.
method_label: This opens new opportunities to research why a specific painting is perceived as emotional.
result_label: We also demonstrate how quantification of evidence for positive and negative emotions can be used to predict the way in which people observe paintings.

TITLE: Enhancing the Measurement of Social Effects by Capturing Morality
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe investigate the relationship between basic principles of human morality and the expression of opinions in user-generated text data.
background_label: We assume that people's backgrounds, culture, and values are associated with their perceptions and expressions of everyday topics, and that people's language use reflects these perceptions.
background_label: While personal values and social effects are abstract and complex concepts, they have practical implications and are relevant for a wide range of NLP applications.
method_label: To extract human values (in this paper, morality) and measure social effects (morality and stance), we empirically evaluate the usage of a morality lexicon that we expanded via a quality controlled, human in the loop process.
result_label: As a result, we enhanced the Moral Foundations Dictionary in size (from 324 to 4,636 syntactically disambiguated entries) and scope.
method_label: We used both lexica for featurebased and deep learning classification (SVM, RF, and LSTM) to test their usefulness for measuring social effects.
result_label: We find that the enhancement of the original lexicon led to measurable improvements in prediction accuracy for the selected NLP tasks.

TITLE: Identifying Appropriate Support for Propositions in Online User Comments
ABSTRACT: background_label: The ability to analyze the adequacy of supporting information is necessary for determining the strength of an argument.1 This is especially the case for online user comments, which often consist of arguments lacking proper substantiation and reasoning.
objective_label: Thus, we develop a framework for automatically classifying each proposition as UNVERIFIABLE, VERIFIABLE NONEXPERIENTIAL, or VERIFIABLE EXPERIENTIAL2, where the appropriate type of support is reason, evidence, and optional evidence, respectively3.
method_label: Once the existing support for propositions are identified, this classification can provide an estimate of how adequately the arguments have been supported.
result_label: We build a goldstandard dataset of 9,476 sentences and clauses from 1,047 comments submitted to an eRulemaking platform and find that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained with n-grams and additional features capturing the verifiability and experientiality exhibit statistically significant improvement over the unigram baseline, achieving a macro-averaged F1 of 68.99%.

TITLE: Quantitative Study of Individual Emotional States in Social Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Marketing strategies without emotion will not work.
background_label: Emotion stimulates the mind 3,000 times quicker than rational thought.
background_label: Such emotion invokes either a positive or a negative response and physical expressions.
background_label: Understanding the underlying dynamics of users' emotions can efficiently help companies formulate marketing strategies and support after-sale services.
objective_label: While prior work has focused mainly on qualitative aspects, in this paper we present our research on quantitative analysis of how an individual's emotional state can be inferred from her historic emotion log and how this person's emotional state influences (or is influenced by) her friends in the social network.
method_label: We statistically study the dynamics of individual's emotions and discover several interesting as well as important patterns.
method_label: Based on this discovery, we propose an approach referred to as MoodCast to learn to infer individuals' emotional states.
result_label: In both mobile-based social network and online virtual network, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

background_label: It is hard to manually detect these implicit beliefs, intentions and moral foundations of the writers.
method_label: We study and investigate two different tasks, each of which reflect the difficulty of detecting an implicit user's knowledge, intent or belief that may be based on writer's moral foundation: 1) political perspective detection in news articles 2) identification of informational vs. conversational questions in community question answering (CQA) archives and.
method_label: In both tasks we first describe new interesting annotated datasets and make the datasets publicly available.
method_label: Second, we compare various classification algorithms, and show the differences in their performance on both tasks.
result_label: Third, in political perspective detection task we utilize a narrative representation language of local press to identify perspective differences between presumably neutral American and British press.

TITLE: Detecting Hoaxes, Frauds, and Deception in Writing Style Online
ABSTRACT: background_label: In digital forensics, questions often arise about the authors of documents: their identity, demographic background, and whether they can be linked to other documents.
background_label: The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions.
background_label: While stylometry techniques can identify authors with high accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios, their accuracy is reduced to random guessing when faced with authors who intentionally obfuscate their writing style or attempt to imitate that of another author.
background_label: While these results are good for privacy, they raise concerns about fraud.
method_label: We argue that some linguistic features change when people hide their writing style and by identifying those features, stylistic deception can be recognized.
method_label: The major contribution of this work is a method for detecting stylistic deception in written documents.
method_label: We show that using a large feature set, it is possible to distinguish regular documents from deceptive documents with 96.6% accuracy (F-measure).
result_label: We also present an analysis of linguistic features that can be modified to hide writing style.

TITLE: Stance Classification in Online Debates by Recognizing Users' Intentions
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractOnline debate forums provide a rich collection of differing opinions on various topics.
background_label: In dual-sided debates, users present their opinions or judge other's opinions to support their stance.
objective_label: In this paper, we examine the use of users' intentions and debate structure for stance classification of the debate posts.
method_label: We propose a domain independent approach to capture users' intent at sentence level using its dependency parse and sentiWordNet and to build the intention structure of the post to identify its stance.
method_label: To aid the task of classification, we define the health of the debate structure and show that maximizing its value leads to better stance classification accuracies.

TITLE: Distinguishing Fact from Fiction: Pattern Recognition in Texts Using Complex Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: We establish concrete mathematical criteria to distinguish between different kinds of written storytelling, fictional and non-fictional.
method_label: Specifically, we constructed a semantic network from both novels and news stories, with $N$ independent words as vertices or nodes, and edges or links allotted to words occurring within $m$ places of a given vertex; we call $m$ the word distance.
method_label: We then used measures from complex network theory to distinguish between news and fiction, studying the minimal text length needed as well as the optimized word distance $m$.
method_label: The literature samples were found to be most effectively represented by their corresponding power laws over degree distribution $P(k)$ and clustering coefficient $C(k)$; we also studied the mean geodesic distance, and found all our texts were small-world networks.
result_label: We observed a natural break-point at $k=\sqrt{N}$ where the power law in the degree distribution changed, leading to separate power law fit for the bulk and the tail of $P(k)$.
result_label: Our linear discriminant analysis yielded a $73.8 \pm 5.15%$ accuracy for the correct classification of novels and $69.1 \pm 1.22%$ for news stories.
result_label: We found an optimal word distance of $m=4$ and a minimum text length of 100 to 200 words $N$.

TITLE: Recognizing Stances in Online Debates
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents an unsupervised opinion analysis method for debate-side classification, i.e., recognizing which stance a person is taking in an online debate.
method_label: In order to handle the complexities of this genre, we mine the web to learn associations that are indicative of opinion stances in debates.
method_label: We combine this knowledge with discourse information, and formulate the debate side classification task as an Integer Linear Programming problem.
result_label: Our results show that our method is substantially better than challenging baseline methods.

TITLE: Finding Good Conversations Online: The Yahoo News Annotated Comments Corpus
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractThis work presents a dataset and annotation scheme for the new task of identifying "good" conversations that occur online, which we call ERICs: Engaging, Respectful, and/or Informative Conversations.
method_label: We develop a taxonomy to reflect features of entire threads and individual comments which we believe contribute to identifying ERICs; code a novel dataset of Yahoo News comment threads (2.4k threads and 10k comments) and 1k threads from the Internet Argument Corpus; and analyze the features characteristic of ERICs.
method_label: This is one of the largest annotated corpora of online human dialogues, with the most detailed set of annotations.
result_label: It will be valuable for identifying ERICs and other aspects of argumentation, dialogue, and discourse.

TITLE: Us and Them: Adversarial Politics on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social-media debates on longitudinal political topics often take the form of adversarial discussions: highly polarized user posts, favoring one of two opposing parties, over an extended time period.
background_label: Recent prominent cases are the US Presidential campaign and the UK Brexit referendum.
objective_label: This paper approaches such discussions as a multi-faceted data space, and applies data mining to identify interesting patterns and factors of influence.
result_label: Specifically, we study how topics are addressed by different parties, their factual and "post-factual" undertones, and the role of highly active "power users" on either side of the discussion.

TITLE: Discourse-Level Argumentation In Scientific Articles: Human And Automatic Annotation
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper we present a rhetorically defined annotation scheme which is part of our corpus-based method for the summarisation of scientific articles.
method_label: The annotation scheme consists of seven non-hierarchical labels which model prototypical academic argumentation and expected intentional 'moves'.
method_label: In a large-scale experiments with three expert coders, we found the scheme stable and reproducible.
result_label: We have built a resource consisting of 80 papers annotated by the scheme, and we show that this kind of resource can be used to train a system to automate the annotation work.

TITLE: Finding Arguing Expressions of Divergent Viewpoints in Online Debates
ABSTRACT: background_label: This work suggests a fine-grained mining of contentious documents, specifically online debates, towards a summarization of contention issues.
objective_label: We propose a Joint Topic Viewpoint model (JTV) for the unsupervised identification and the clustering of arguing expressions according to the latent topics they discuss and the implicit viewpoints they voice.
method_label: A set of experiments is conducted on online debates documents.
method_label: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the model’s output are performed in context of different contention issues.
result_label: Analysis of experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed model to automatically and accurately detect recurrent patterns of arguing expressions in online debate texts.

TITLE: A Multidimensional Lexicon for Interpersonal Stancetaking
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThe sociolinguistic construct of stancetaking describes the activities through which discourse participants create and signal relationships to their interlocutors, to the topic of discussion, and to the talk itself.
background_label: Stancetaking underlies a wide range of interactional phenomena, relating to formality, politeness, affect, and subjectivity.
method_label: We present a computational approach to stancetaking, in which we build a theoretically-motivated lexicon of stance markers, and then use multidimensional analysis to identify a set of underlying stance dimensions.
result_label: We validate these dimensions intrinsically and extrinsically, showing that they are internally coherent, match pre-registered hypotheses, and correlate with social phenomena.

method_label: We build supervised systems employing sentiment and arguing opinions and their targets as features.
method_label: Our systems perform substantially better than a distribution-based baseline.
result_label: Additionally, by employing both types of opinion features, we are able to perform better than a unigrambased system.

TITLE: Measuring the quality of web content using factual information
ABSTRACT: background_label: Nowadays, many decisions are based on information found in the Web.
background_label: For the most part, the disseminating sources are not certified, and hence an assessment of the quality and credibility of Web content became more important than ever.
method_label: With factual density we present a simple statistical quality measure that is based on facts extracted from Web content using Open Information Extraction.
method_label: In a first case study, we use this measure to identify featured/good articles in Wikipedia.
method_label: We compare the factual density measure with word count, a measure that has successfully been applied to this task in the past.
result_label: Our evaluation corroborates the good performance of word count in Wikipedia since featured/good articles are often longer than non-featured.
result_label: However, for articles of similar lengths the word count measure fails while factual density can separate between them with an F-measure of 90.4%.
result_label: We also investigate the use of relational features for categorizing Wikipedia articles into featured/good versus non-featured ones.
result_label: If articles have similar lengths, we achieve an F-measure of 86.7% and 84% otherwise.

TITLE: Harvesting Creative Templates for Generating Stylistically Varied Restaurant Reviews
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many of the creative and figurative elements that make language exciting are lost in translation in current natural language generation engines.
objective_label: In this paper, we explore a method to harvest templates from positive and negative reviews in the restaurant domain, with the goal of vastly expanding the types of stylistic variation available to the natural language generator.
method_label: We learn hyperbolic adjective patterns that are representative of the strongly-valenced expressive language commonly used in either positive or negative reviews.
method_label: We then identify and delexicalize entities, and use heuristics to extract generation templates from review sentences.
method_label: We evaluate the learned templates against more traditional review templates, using subjective measures of"convincingness","interestingness", and"naturalness".
result_label: Our results show that the learned templates score highly on these measures.
result_label: Finally, we analyze the linguistic categories that characterize the learned positive and negative templates.
result_label: We plan to use the learned templates to improve the conversational style of dialogue systems in the restaurant domain.

TITLE: Using Argumentative Structure to Interpret Debates in Online Deliberative Democracy and eRulemaking
ABSTRACT: background_label: Governments around the world are increasingly utilising online platforms and social media to engage with, and ascertain the opinions of, their citizens.
background_label: Whilst policy makers could potentially benefit from such enormous feedback from society, they first face the challenge of making sense out of the large volumes of data produced.
method_label: In this article, we show how the analysis of argumentative and dialogical structures allows for the principled identification of those issues that are central, controversial, or popular in an online corpus of debates.
method_label: Although areas such as controversy mining work towards identifying issues that are a source of disagreement, by looking at the deeper argumentative structure, we show that a much richer understanding can be obtained.
result_label: We provide results from using a pipeline of argument-mining techniques on the debate corpus, showing that the accuracy obtained is sufficient to automatically identify those issues that are key to the discussion, attracting proportionately more support than others, and those that are divisive, attracting proportionately more conflicting viewpoints.

TITLE: Emotion Recognition from Text Using Knowledge-based ANN
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper proposes an emotion recognition system.
background_label: Human emotion can be expressed through many kinds of medium such as speech, image, facial expression, and so forth.
objective_label: This paper focuses on the textual data of them.
method_label: Proposed system is a hybrid system that uses alternatively two methods, keyword-based and machine learning method.
method_label: Keyword-based methods are traditional approaches using emotional keywords to make a decision of emotional state.
method_label: They are very correct if emotional keywords exist within text segment.
method_label: However, there is nothing to do if keywords to be able to catch emotional state do not exist.
method_label: Therefore, in the case of no emotional keywords, our proposed method uses KBANN to able to infer emotional state through implicit knowledge constructed with the third-party information.
result_label: Finally, through experiments, we show that the proposed system is more accurate than some previous approaches.

TITLE: Unveiling What Is Written in the Stars: Analyzing Explicit, Implicit, and Discourse Patterns of Sentiment in Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Deciphering consumers' sentiment expressions from big data (e.g., online reviews) has become a managerial priority to monitor product and service evaluations.
background_label: However, sentiment analysis, the process of automatically distilling sentiment from text, provides little insight regarding the language granularities beyond the use of positive and negative words.
objective_label: Drawing on speech act theory, this study provides a fine-grained analysis of the implicit and explicit language used by consumers to express sentiment in text.
result_label: An empirical text-mining study using more than 45,000 consumer reviews demonstrates the differential impacts of activation levels (e.g., tentative language), implicit sentiment expressions (e.g., commissive language), and discourse patterns (e.g., incoherence) on overall consumer sentiment (i.e., star ratings).
result_label: In two follow-up studies, we demonstrate that these speech act features also influence the readers' behavior and are generalizable to other social media contexts, such as Twitter and Facebook.
result_label: We contribute to research on consumer sentiment analysis by offering a more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments and their implications.

TITLE: Distinguishing systems and distinguishing senses: new evaluation methods for Word Sense Disambiguation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) made a set of observations about the state-of-the-art in automatic word sense disambiguation and, motivated by those observations, offered several specific proposals regarding improved evaluation criteria, common training and testing resources, and the definition of sense inventories.
background_label: Subsequent discussion of those proposals resulted in SENSEVAL, the first evaluation exercise for word sense disambiguation (Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000).
method_label: This article is a revised and extended version of our 1997 workshop paper, reviewing its observations and proposals and discussing them in light of the SENSEVAL exercise.
method_label: It also includes a new in-depth empirical study of translingually-based sense inventories and distance measures, using statistics collected from native-speaker annotations of 222 polysemous contexts across 12 languages.
result_label: These data show that monolingual sense distinctions at most levels of granularity can be effectively captured by translations into some set of second languages, especially as language family distance increases.
result_label: In addition, the probability that a given sense pair will tend to lexicalize differently across languages is shown to correlate with semantic salience and sense granularity; sense hierarchies automatically generated from such distance matrices yield results remarkably similar to those created by professional monolingual lexicographers.

TITLE: What Lies Beneath: The Linguistic Traces of Deception in Online Dating Profiles
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article investigates whether deceptions in online dating profiles correlate with changes in the way daters write about themselves in the free-text portion of the profile, and whether these changes are detectable by both computerized linguistic analyses and human judges.
background_label: Computerized analyses (Study 1) found that deceptions manifested themselves through linguistic cues pertaining to (a) liars’ emotions and cognitions and (b) liars’ strategic efforts to manage their self-presentations.
method_label: Technological affordances (i.e., asynchronicity and editability) affected the production of cognitive cues more than that of emotional cues.
method_label: Human judges (Study 2) relied on different and nonpredictive linguistic cues to assess daters’ trustworthiness.
result_label: The findings inform theories concerned with deception, media, and self-presentation, and also expound on how writing style influences perceived trustworthiness.

TITLE: Emotion Actuator: Embodied Emotional Feedback through Electroencephalography and Electrical Muscle Stimulation
ABSTRACT: background_label: The human body reveals emotional and bodily states through measurable signals, such as body language and electroencephalography.
background_label: However, such manifestations are difficult to communicate to others remotely.
method_label: We propose EmotionActuator, a proof-of-concept system to investigate the transmission of emotional states in which the recipient performs emotional gestures to understand and interpret the state of the sender.We call this kind of communication embodied emotional feedback, and present a prototype implementation.
method_label: To realize our concept we chose four emotional states: amused, sad, angry, and neutral.
method_label: We designed EmotionActuator through a series of studies to assess emotional classification via EEG, and create an EMS gesture set by comparing composed gestures from the literature to sign-language gestures.
result_label: Through a final study with the end-to-end prototype interviews revealed that participants like implicit sharing of emotions and find the embodied output to be immersive, but want to have control over shared emotions and with whom.
result_label: This work contributes a proof of concept system and set of design recommendations for designing embodied emotional feedback systems.

TITLE: Multidimensional Outlier Detection in Temporal Interaction Networks: An Application to Political Communication on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: In social network Twitter, users can interact with each other and spread information via retweets.
background_label: These millions of interactions may result in media events whose influence goes beyond Twitter framework.
objective_label: In this paper, we thoroughly explore interactions to provide a better understanding of the emergence of certain trends.
method_label: First, we consider an interaction on Twitter to be a triplet $(s,a,t)$ meaning that user $s$, called the spreader, has retweeted a tweet of user $a$, called the author, at time $t$.
method_label: We model this set of interactions as a data cube with three dimensions: spreaders, authors and time.
method_label: Then, we provide a method which builds different contexts, where a context is a set of features characterizing the circumstances of an event.
other_label: Finally, these contexts allow us to find relevant unexpected behaviors, according to several dimensions and various perspectives: a user during a given hour which is abnormal compared to its usual behavior, a relationship between two users which is abnormal compared to all other relationships, \textit{etc.}
method_label: We apply our method to a set of retweets related to the 2017 French presidential election and show that one can build interesting insights regarding political organization on Twitter.

TITLE: What's in an accent? The impact of accented synthetic speech on lexical choice in human-machine dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: The assumptions we make about a dialogue partner's knowledge and communicative ability (i.e.
background_label: our partner models) can influence our language choices.
background_label: Although similar processes may operate in human-machine dialogue, the role of design in shaping these models, and their subsequent effects on interaction are not clearly understood.
method_label: Focusing on synthesis design, we conduct a referential communication experiment to identify the impact of accented speech on lexical choice.
method_label: In particular, we focus on whether accented speech may encourage the use of lexical alternatives that are relevant to a partner's accent, and how this is may vary when in dialogue with a human or machine.
result_label: We find that people are more likely to use American English terms when speaking with a US accented partner than an Irish accented partner in both human and machine conditions.
result_label: This lends support to the proposal that synthesis design can influence partner perception of lexical knowledge, which in turn guide user's lexical choices.
result_label: We discuss the findings with relation to the nature and dynamics of partner models in human machine dialogue.

TITLE: Are you serious?: Rhetorical Questions and Sarcasm in Social Media Dialog
ABSTRACT: background_label: Effective models of social dialog must understand a broad range of rhetorical and figurative devices.
background_label: Rhetorical questions (RQs) are a type of figurative language whose aim is to achieve a pragmatic goal, such as structuring an argument, being persuasive, emphasizing a point, or being ironic.
background_label: While there are computational models for other forms of figurative language, rhetorical questions have received little attention to date.
method_label: We expand a small dataset from previous work, presenting a corpus of 10,270 RQs from debate forums and Twitter that represent different discourse functions.
method_label: We show that we can clearly distinguish between RQs and sincere questions (0.76 F1).
method_label: We then show that RQs can be used both sarcastically and non-sarcastically, observing that non-sarcastic (other) uses of RQs are frequently argumentative in forums, and persuasive in tweets.
result_label: We present experiments to distinguish between these uses of RQs using SVM and LSTM models that represent linguistic features and post-level context, achieving results as high as 0.76 F1 for"sarcastic"and 0.77 F1 for"other"in forums, and 0.83 F1 for both"sarcastic"and"other"in tweets.
result_label: We supplement our quantitative experiments with an in-depth characterization of the linguistic variation in RQs.

background_label: Providers of such content exert a certain level of influence on the receivers and this is evident from blog sites having effect on their readers’ purchase decisions, political view points, financial planning, and others.
method_label: By detecting the opinion expressed, we can identify the sentiments on the topics discussed and the influence exerted on the readers.
method_label: In this paper, we introduce an automatic approach in deriving polarity pattern rules to detect sentiment polarity at the phrase level, and in addition consider the effects of the more complex relationships found between words in sentiment polarity classification.
method_label: Recent sentiment analysis research has focused on the functional relations of words using typed dependency parsing, providing a refined analysis on the grammar and semantics of textual data.
method_label: Heuristics are typically used to determine the typed dependency polarity patterns, which may not comprehensively identify all possible rules.
method_label: We study the use of class sequential rules (CSRs) to automatically learn the typed dependency patterns, and benchmark the performance of CSR against a heuristic method.
result_label: Preliminary results show CSR leads to further improvements in classification performance achieving over 80% F1 scores in the test cases.
result_label: In addition, we observe more complex relationships between words that could influence phrase sentiment polarity, and further discuss on possible approaches to handle the effects of these complex relationships.

TITLE: Politics, sharing and emotion in microblogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: In political contexts, it is known that people act as "motivated reasoners", i.e., information is evaluated first for emotional affect, and this emotional reaction influences later deliberative reasoning steps.
background_label: As social media becomes a more and more prevalent way of receiving political information, it becomes important to understand more completely the interaction between information, emotion, social community, and information-sharing behavior.
method_label: In this paper, we describe a high-precision classifier for politically-oriented tweets, and an accurate classifier of a Twitter user's political affiliation.
method_label: Coupled with existing sentiment-analysis tools for microblogs, these methods enable us to systematically study the interaction of emotion and sharing in a large corpus of politically-oriented microblog messages, collected from just before the 2012 US presidential election.
result_label: In particular, we seek to understand how information sharing is influenced by the political affiliation of the sender and receiver of a message, and the sentiment associated with the message.

ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe a dialogue model and an implemented annotation scheme for a pilot corpus of annotated online chats concerning bargaining negotiations in the game The Settlers of Catan.
method_label: We will use this model and data to analyze how conversations proceed in the absence of strong forms of cooperativity, where agents have diverging motives.
result_label: Here we concentrate on the description of our annotation scheme for negotiation dialogues, illustrated with our pilot data, and some perspectives for future research on the issue.

TITLE: Predicting and Eliciting Addressee's Emotion in Online Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWhile there have been many attempts to estimate the emotion of an addresser from her/his utterance, few studies have explored how her/his utterance affects the emotion of the addressee.
objective_label: This has motivated us to investigate two novel tasks: predicting the emotion of the addressee and generating a response that elicits a specific emotion in the addressee's mind.
method_label: We target Japanese Twitter posts as a source of dialogue data and automatically build training data for learning the predictors and generators.
result_label: The feasibility of our approaches is assessed by using 1099 utterance-response pairs that are built by five human workers.

TITLE: Love, Affiliation, and Emotional Recognition in #kämpamalmö:— The Social Role of Emotional Language in Twitter Discourse:
ABSTRACT: background_label: While emotional language and imagery in protest esthetics are nothing new, emotions have been repressed in modern political discourse at large, as being seen as irrational if not dangerous.
background_label: As new media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, are becoming central media spaces for live online broadcasting of political protests, they have become an important site of discursive struggle for researchers to take into account.
objective_label: This article argues that emotional language use is not merely something excessive but a central discursive resource for participants in communicating their political and social relations.
method_label: The analysis in this article is based on data collected from the Twitter hashtag #kampamalmo during an anti-fascist demonstration that took place in Malmo, Sweden in 2014.
method_label: Methodologically, this article is guided by a critical discourse analytical approach, with a focus on how emotional language use allows participants to form collectivities.
result_label: Empirically, the article identifies how participants make use...

TITLE: Modeling user context for valence prediction from narratives
ABSTRACT: background_label: Automated prediction of valence, one key feature of a person's emotional state, from individuals' personal narratives may provide crucial information for mental healthcare (e.g.
background_label: early diagnosis of mental diseases, supervision of disease course, etc.).
background_label: In the Interspeech 2018 ComParE Self-Assessed Affect challenge, the task of valence prediction was framed as a three-class classification problem using 8 seconds fragments from individuals' narratives.
background_label: As such, the task did not allow for exploring contextual information of the narratives.
objective_label: In this work, we investigate the intrinsic information from multiple narratives recounted by the same individual in order to predict their current state-of-mind.
objective_label: Furthermore, with generalizability in mind, we decided to focus our experiments exclusively on textual information as the public availability of audio narratives is limited compared to text.
result_label: Our hypothesis is, that context modeling might provide insights about emotion triggering concepts (e.g.
objective_label: events, people, places) mentioned in the narratives that are linked to an individual's state of mind.
method_label: We explore multiple machine learning techniques to model narratives.
result_label: We find that the models are able to capture inter-individual differences, leading to more accurate predictions of an individual's emotional state, as compared to single narratives.

TITLE: A categorized list of emotion definitions, with suggestions for a consensual definition
ABSTRACT: background_label: A major problem in the field of emotion has been the wide variety of definitions that have been proposed.
background_label: In an attempt to resolve the resulting terminological confusion, 92 definitions and 9 skeptical statements were compiled from a variety of sources in the literature of emotion.
method_label: These definitions and statements were classified into an outline of 11 categories, on the basis of the emotional phenomena or theoretical issues emphasized.
method_label: There are two traditional experiential categories of affect and cognition; three physical categories of external emotional stimuli, physiological mechanisms, and emotional/expressive behavior; definitions that emphasize disruptive or adaptive effects; definitions that emphasize the multiaspect nature of emotional phenomena, those that distinguish emotion from other processes, and those that emphasize the overlap between emotion and motivation; and skeptical or disparaging statements about the usefulness of the concept of emotion.
result_label: The definitions are evaluated, trends are identified, and a model definition is proposed.

TITLE: Personal involvement as a determinant of argument-based persuasion.
ABSTRACT: background_label: It was suggested that there are two basic routes to persuasion.
background_label: One route is based on the thoughtful consideration of arguments central to the issue, whereas the other is based on peripheral cues in the persuasion situation.
method_label: To test this view, undergraduates expressed their attitudes on an issue after exposure to a counterattitudinal advocacy containing either strong or weak arguments that emanated from a source of either high or low expertise.
method_label: For some subjects, the communication was high in personal relevance, whereas for others it was low.
result_label: Interactions of the personal relevance manipulation with the argument quality and expertise manipulations revealed that under high relevance, attitudes were influenced primarily by the quality of the arguments in the message, whereas under low relevance, attitudes were influenced primarily by the expertise of the source.
result_label: This suggests that the personal relevance of an issue is one determinant of the route to persuasion that will be followed.

TITLE: Emotion and narrative fiction: Interactive influences before, during, and after reading.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Emotions are central to the experience of literary narrative fiction.
background_label: Affect and mood can influence what book people choose, based partly on whether their goal is to change or maintain their current emotional state.
method_label: Once having chosen a book, the narrative itself acts to evoke and transform emotions, both directly through the events and characters depicted and through the cueing of emotionally valenced memories.
method_label: Once evoked by the story, these emotions can in turn influence a person's experience of the narrative.
background_label: Lastly, emotions experienced during reading may have consequences after closing the covers of a book.
method_label: This article reviews the current state of empirical research for each of these stages, providing a snapshot of what is known about the interaction between emotions and literary narrative fiction.
result_label: With this, we can begin to sketch the outlines of what remains to be discovered.

ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThis paper describes a system for discriminating between factual and non-factual contexts, trained on weakly labeled data by taking advantage of information implicit in annotations of negated events.
method_label: In addition to evaluating factuality detection in isolation, we also evaluate its impact on a system for event detection.
result_label: The two components for factuality detection and event detection form part of a system for identifying negative factual events, or counterfacts, with top-ranked results in the *SEM 2012 shared task.

TITLE: The Generation of Textual Entailment with NLML in an Intelligent Dialogue system for Language Learning CSIEC
ABSTRACT: background_label: This research report introduces the generation of textual entailment within the project CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication), an interactive web-based human-computer dialogue system with natural language for English instruction.
background_label: The generation of textual entailment (GTE) is critical to the further improvement of CSIEC project.
background_label: Up to now we have found few literatures related with GTE.
method_label: Simulating the process that a human being learns English as a foreign language we explore our naive approach to tackle the GTE problem and its algorithm within the framework of CSIEC, i.e.
method_label: rule annotation in NLML, pattern recognition (matching), and entailment transformation.
method_label: The time and space complexity of our algorithm is tested with some entailment examples.
result_label: Further works include the rules annotation based on the English textbooks and a GUI interface for normal users to edit the entailment rules.

TITLE: It's Early: Event-related Potential Evidence for Initial Interaction of Syntax and Prosody in Speech Comprehension
ABSTRACT: background_label: Psycholinguistic theories assume an interaction between prosody and syntax during language processing.
background_label: Based on studies using mostly off-line methods, it is unclear whether an interaction occurs at later or initial processing stages.
method_label: Using event-related potentials, the present study provides neurophysiological evidence for a prosody and syntax interaction in initial processing.
method_label: The sentence material contained mere prosodic and syntactic as well as combined prosodic-syntactic violations.
method_label: For the syntax violation, the critical word appeared after a preposition.
result_label: The suffix of the critical word either indicated a noun fulfilling the syntactic requirements of the preceding preposition or a verb causing a word category violation.
background_label: For the prosodic manipulation, congruent critical words were normally intonated (signaling sentence continuation) while prosodically incongruent critical words signaled sentence end.
background_label: For the mere prosodic incongruity, a broadly distributed negativity was observed at the critical word-stem (300500 msec aligned to word onset).
method_label: In response to a mere syntactic error, a left temporal negativity was elicited in an early time window (200400 msec aligned to suffix onset), taken to reflect initial phrase structure building processes.
method_label: In contrast, in response to the combined prosodic-syntactic violation, an early temporal negativity showed up bilaterally at the suffix in the same time window.
result_label: Our interpretation is that the process of initial structure building as reflected in the early left anterior negativity recruits additional right hemispheric neural resources when the critical word contains both syntactic and prosodic violations.
result_label: This suggests the immediate influence of phrasal prosody during the initial parsing stage in speech processing.

TITLE: Emotional Stress, Positive Emotions, and Psychophysiological Coherence
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this chapter, we describe two core tools of the HeartMath system, the Freeze-Frame and Heart Lock-In techniques, and then explore the scientific basis of their effectiveness.
background_label: This discussion is built upon a conceptual framework that emphasizes the emotional component of the experience of stress and the proposition that truly transforming stress requires intervention at the emotional level.
method_label: To understand how stress is generated and processed in the brain and body, we present a model of emotion, based on Pribram’s theory, in which the brain functions as a complex pattern-matching system.
method_label: From this perspective, it is shown that the heart is a key component of the emotional system, with the patterns of its extensive inputs to the brain making an important contribution to emotional experience.
method_label: We also provide an overview of the Institute of HeartMath’s research on the physiological correlates of positive emotions, which has led to the characterization of a distinctive mode of psychophysiological functioning known as psychophysiological coherence.
method_label: Through the use of tools and technologies that foster positive emotions and psychophysiological coherence, individuals can effectively initiate a repatterning process, whereby habitual emotional patterns underlying stress are replaced with new, healthier patterns that establish increased emotional stability, mental acuity, and physiological efficiency as a new familiar baseline or norm.

TITLE: Gated Recurrent Neural Network Approach for Multilabel Emotion Detection in Microblogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: People express their opinions and emotions freely in social media posts and online reviews that contain valuable feedback for multiple stakeholders such as businesses and political campaigns.
background_label: Manually extracting opinions and emotions from large volumes of such posts is an impossible task.
background_label: Therefore, automated processing of these posts to extract opinions and emotions is an important research problem.
background_label: However, human emotion detection is a challenging task due to the complexity and nuanced nature.
method_label: To overcome these barriers, researchers have extensively used techniques such as deep learning, distant supervision, and transfer learning.
method_label: In this paper, we propose a novel Pyramid Attention Network (PAN) based model for emotion detection in microblogs.
method_label: The main advantage of our approach is that PAN has the capability to evaluate sentences in different perspectives to capture multiple emotions existing in a single text.
result_label: The proposed model was evaluated on a recently released dataset and the results achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.9%.

TITLE: Get out the vote: Determining support or opposition from Congressional floor-debate transcripts
ABSTRACT: background_label: We investigate whether one can determine from the transcripts of U.S. Congressional floor debates whether the speeches represent support of or opposition to proposed legislation.
method_label: To address this problem, we exploit the fact that these speeches occur as part of a discussion; this allows us to use sources of information regarding relationships between discourse segments, such as whether a given utterance indicates agreement with the opinion expressed by another.
result_label: We find that the incorporation of such information yields substantial improvements over classifying speeches in isolation.

TITLE: Brand-Related Events Detection, Classification and Summarization on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: The huge and ever increasing amount of text generated by Twitter users everyday embeds a wealth of information, in particular, about themes that become suddenly relevant to many users as well as about the sentiment polarity that users tend to associate with these themes.
method_label: In this paper, we exploit both these opportunities and propose a method for: (i) detecting novel popular themes, i.e.
method_label: events, (ii) summarizing these events by means of a concise yet meaningful representation, and (iii) assessing the prevalent sentiment polarity associated with each event, i.e., positive vs. negative.
method_label: Our method is fully unsupervised and requires only a precompiled topic description in the form of set of potentially relevant keywords that might appear in the events of interest.
result_label: We validate our proposal on a real corpus of about 8,000,000 tweets, by detecting, classifying and summarizing events related to three wide topics associated with tech-related brands.

TITLE: Affective learning companions: strategies for empathetic agents with real-time multimodal affective sensing to foster meta-cognitive and meta-affective approaches to learning, motivation, and perseverance
ABSTRACT: background_label: This thesis has developed an affective agent research platform that advances the architecture of relational agents and intelligent tutoring systems.
background_label: The system realizes non-invasive multimodal real-time sensing of elements of user's affective state and couples this ability with an agent capable of supporting learners by engaging in real-time responsive expressivity.
background_label: The agent mirrors several nonverbal behaviors believed to influence persuasion, liking, and social rapport, and responds to frustration with empathetic or task-support dialogue.
method_label: Pilot studies involved 60 participants, ages 10-14 years-old, and led to an experiment involving 76 participants, ages 11-13 years-old, engaging in the Towers of Hanoi activity.
method_label: The system (data collection, architecture, character interaction, and activity presentation) was iteratively tested and refined, and two "mirroring" conditions were developed: "sensor driven non-verbal interactions" and "pre-recorded non-verbal interactions".
result_label: The development and training of the classifier algorithms showed the ability to predict frustration/help seeking behavior with 79% accuracy across a pilot group of 24 participants.
method_label: Informed by the theory of optimal experience (Flow) and a parallel theory of a state of non-optimal experience (Stuck), developed in this thesis, the effects of "affective support" and "task support" interventions, through agent dialogue and non-verbal interactions, were evaluated relative to their appropriateness for the learner's affective state.
result_label: Outcomes were assessed with respect to measures of agent emotional intelligence, social bond, and persuasion, and with respect to learner frustration, perseverance, metacognitive and meta-affective ability, beliefs of one's ability to increase one's own intelligence, and goal-mastery-orientation.
background_label: A new simple measure of departure dialogue was shown to have a significant relationship with the more lengthy and explicit social bond Working Alliance Inventory survey instrument; its validity was further supported through its use in assessing the social bond relationship with other measures.
method_label: Over-estimation of the duration of the activity was associated with increased frustration.
result_label: Gender differences were obtained with girls showing stronger outcomes when presented with affect-support interventions and boys with task-support interventions.
result_label: Coordinating the character's mirroring with intervention type and learners' frustration was shown to be important.

TITLE: A Wizard-of-Oz Study on A Non-Task-Oriented Dialog Systems That Reacts to User Engagement
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper, we describe a system that reacts to both possible system breakdowns and low user engagement with a set of conversational strategies.
background_label: These general strategies reduce the number of inappropriate responses and produce better user engagement.
background_label: We also found that a system that reacts to both possible system breakdowns and low user engagement is rated by both experts and non-experts as having better overall user engagement compared to a system that only reacts to possible system breakdowns.
method_label: We argue that for non-task-oriented systems we should optimize on both system response appropriateness and user engagement.
result_label: We also found that apart from making the system response appropriate, funny and provocative responses can also lead to better user engagement.
result_label: On the other hand, short appropriate responses, such as "Yes" or "No" can lead to decreased user engagement.
result_label: We will use these findings to further improve our system.

TITLE: Modeling Temporal Progression of Emotional Status in Mental Health Forum: A Recurrent Neural Net Approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractPatients turn to Online Health Communities not only for information on specific conditions but also for emotional support.
background_label: Previous research has indicated that the progression of emotional status can be studied through the linguistic patterns of an individual's posts.
method_label: We analyze a realworld dataset from the Mental Health section of healthboards.com.
method_label: Estimated from the word usages in their posts, we find that the emotional progress across patients vary widely.We study the problem of predicting a patient's emotional status in the future from her past posts and we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architecture to address it.
method_label: We find that the future emotional status can be predicted with reasonable accuracy given her historical posts and participation features.
result_label: Our evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architecture, by outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with over 0.13 reduction in Mean Absolute Error.

TITLE: Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion.
ABSTRACT: background_label: In Experiment 1, subjects read a persuasive message from a likable or unlikable communicator who presented six or two arguments concerning one of two topics.
background_label: High response involvement subjects anticipated discussing the message topic at a future experimental session, whereas low involvement subjects anticipated discussing a different topic.
background_label: For high involvement subjects, opinion change was significantly greater given six arguments but was unaffected by communicator likability.
result_label: For low involvement subjects, opinion change was significantly greater given a likable communicator but was unaffected by the arguments manipulation.
result_label: In Experiment 2, high issue involvement subjects showed slightly greater opinion change when exposed to five arguments from an unlikable (vs. one argument from a likable) communicator, whereas low involvement subjects exhibited significantly greater persuasion in response to one argument from a likable (vs. five arguments from an unlikable) communicator.
result_label: These findings support the idea that high involvement leads message recipients to employ a systematic information processing strategy in which message-based cognitions mediate persuasion, whereas low involvement leads recipients to use a heuristic processing strategy in which simple decision rules mediate persuasion.
result_label: Support was also obtained for the hypothesis that content-mediated (vs. source-mediated) opinion change would shower greater persistence.

TITLE: Argument Strength is in the Eye of the Beholder: Audience Effects in Persuasion
ABSTRACT: background_label: Americans spend about a third of their time online, with many participating in online conversations on social and political issues.
background_label: We hypothesize that social media arguments on such issues may be more engaging and persuasive than traditional media summaries, and that particular types of people may be more or less convinced by particular styles of argument, e.g.
background_label: emotional arguments may resonate with some personalities while factual arguments resonate with others.
method_label: We report a set of experiments testing at large scale how audience variables interact with argument style to affect the persuasiveness of an argument, an under-researched topic within natural language processing.
result_label: We show that belief change is affected by personality factors, with conscientious, open and agreeable people being more convinced by emotional arguments.

TITLE: Linguistic Diversities of Demographic Groups in Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: The massive popularity of online social media provides a unique opportunity for researchers to study the linguistic characteristics and patterns of user's interactions.
background_label: In this paper, we provide an in-depth characterization of language usage across demographic groups in Twitter.
method_label: In particular, we extract the gender and race of Twitter users located in the U.S. using advanced image processing algorithms from Face++.
method_label: Then, we investigate how demographic groups (i.e.
method_label: male/female, Asian/Black/White) differ in terms of linguistic styles and also their interests.
method_label: We extract linguistic features from 6 categories (affective attributes, cognitive attributes, lexical density and awareness, temporal references, social and personal concerns, and interpersonal focus), in order to identify the similarities and differences in particular writing set of attributes.
method_label: In addition, we extract the absolute ranking difference of top phrases between demographic groups.
method_label: As a dimension of diversity, we also use the topics of interest that we retrieve from each user.
result_label: Our analysis unveils clear differences in the writing styles (and the topics of interest) of different demographic groups, with variation seen across both gender and race lines.
result_label: We hope our effort can stimulate the development of new studies related to demographic information in the online space.

ABSTRACT: background_label: Previous approaches to pronominalization have largely been theoretical rather than applied in nature.
background_label: Frequently, such methods are based on Centering Theory, which deals with the resolution of anaphoric pronouns.
background_label: But it is not clear that complex theoretical mechanisms, while having satisfying explanatory power, are necessary for the actual generation of pronouns.
method_label: We first illustrate examples of pronouns from various domains, describe a simple method for generating pronouns in an implemented multi-page generation system, and present an evaluation of its performance.

ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn structured argumentation frameworks such as ASPIC + , rebuts are only allowed in conclusions produced by defeasible rules.
background_label: This has been criticized as counter-intuitive especially in dialectical contexts.
objective_label: In this paper we show that ASPIC − , a system allowing for unrestricted rebuts, suffers from contamination problems.
method_label: We remedy this shortcoming by generalizing the attack rule of unrestricted rebut.
method_label: Our resulting system satisfies the usual rationality postulates for prioritized rule bases.

TITLE: Emotion regulation in the workplace: a new way to conceptualize emotional labor.
ABSTRACT: background_label: The topic of emotions in the workplace is beginning to garner closer attention by researchers and theorists.
background_label: The study of emotional labor addresses the stress of managing emotions when the work role demands that certain expressions be shown to customers.
background_label: However, there has been no overarching framework to guide this work, and the previous studies have often disagreed on the definition and operationalization of emotional labor.
objective_label: The purposes of this article are as follows: to review and compare previous perspectives of emotional labor, to provide a definition of emotional labor that integrates these perspectives, to discuss emotion regulation as a guiding theory for understanding the mechanisms of emotional labor, and to present a model of emotional labor that includes individual differences (such as emotional intelligence) and organizational factors (such as supervisor support).

TITLE: Frowning Frodo, Wincing Leia, and a Seriously Great Friendship: Learning to Classify Emotional Relationships of Fictional Characters
ABSTRACT: background_label: The development of a fictional plot is centered around characters who closely interact with each other forming dynamic social networks.
background_label: In literature analysis, such networks have mostly been analyzed without particular relation types or focusing on roles which the characters take with respect to each other.
background_label: We argue that an important aspect for the analysis of stories and their development is the emotion between characters.
objective_label: In this paper, we combine these aspects into a unified framework to classify emotional relationships of fictional characters.
method_label: We formalize it as a new task and describe the annotation of a corpus, based on fan-fiction short stories.
method_label: The extraction pipeline which we propose consists of character identification (which we treat as given by an oracle here) and the relation classification.
result_label: For the latter, we provide results using several approaches previously proposed for relation identification with neural methods.
result_label: The best result of 0.45 F1 is achieved with a GRU with character position indicators on the task of predicting undirected emotion relations in the associated social network graph.

TITLE: DeepMind_Commentary
ABSTRACT: background_label: We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based reasoning is essential.
background_label: However, we favor an approach that centers on one additional ingredient: autonomy.
objective_label: In particular, we aim toward agents that can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human hand-engineering.
method_label: We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not available.
result_label: Here we survey several important examples of the progress that has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities, and highlight some outstanding challenges.

TITLE: Understanding the Radical Mind: Identifying Signals to Detect Extremist Content on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Internet and, in particular, Online Social Networks have changed the way that terrorist and extremist groups can influence and radicalise individuals.
background_label: Recent reports show that the mode of operation of these groups starts by exposing a wide audience to extremist material online, before migrating them to less open online platforms for further radicalization.
background_label: Thus, identifying radical content online is crucial to limit the reach and spread of the extremist narrative.
objective_label: In this paper, our aim is to identify measures to automatically detect radical content in social media.
method_label: We identify several signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that together allow for the classification of radical messages.
method_label: Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we analyze propaganda material published by extremist groups and create a contextual text-based model of radical content, (2) we build a model of psychological properties inferred from these material, and (3) we evaluate these models on Twitter to determine the extent to which it is possible to automatically identify online radical tweets.
result_label: Our results show that radical users do exhibit distinguishable textual, psychological, and behavioural properties.
result_label: We find that the psychological properties are among the most distinguishing features.
result_label: Additionally, our results show that textual models using vector embedding features significantly improves the detection over TF-IDF features.
result_label: We validate our approach on two experiments achieving high accuracy.
result_label: Our findings can be utilized as signals for detecting online radicalization activities.

TITLE: Using Multiple Sources of Agreement Information for Sentiment Classification of Political Transcripts
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSentiment classifiers attempt to determine whether a document expresses a generally positive or negative sentiment about its topic.
background_label: Previous work has shown that overall performance can be improved by combining per-document classifications with information about agreement between documents.
objective_label: This paper explores approaches to sentiment classification of U.S Congressional floor debate transcripts that use a model for incorporating multiple sources of information about agreements between speakers.
result_label: An empirical evaluation demonstrates accuracy improvements over previously published results.

TITLE: Contradiction Detection for Rumorous Claims
ABSTRACT: background_label: The utilization of social media material in journalistic workflows is increasing, demanding automated methods for the identification of mis- and disinformation.
objective_label: Since textual contradiction across social media posts can be a signal of rumorousness, we seek to model how claims in Twitter posts are being textually contradicted.
method_label: We identify two different contexts in which contradiction emerges: its broader form can be observed across independently posted tweets and its more specific form in threaded conversations.
method_label: We define how the two scenarios differ in terms of central elements of argumentation: claims and conversation structure.
method_label: We design and evaluate models for the two scenarios uniformly as 3-way Recognizing Textual Entailment tasks in order to represent claims and conversation structure implicitly in a generic inference model, while previous studies used explicit or no representation of these properties.
method_label: To address noisy text, our classifiers use simple similarity features derived from the string and part-of-speech level.
result_label: Corpus statistics reveal distribution differences for these features in contradictory as opposed to non-contradictory tweet relations, and the classifiers yield state of the art performance.

TITLE: What Your Face Vlogs About: Expressions of Emotion and Big-Five Traits Impressions in YouTube
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social video sites where people share their opinions and feelings are increasing in popularity.
background_label: The face is known to reveal important aspects of human psychological traits, so the understanding of how facial expressions relate to personal constructs is a relevant problem in social media.
objective_label: We present a study of the connections between automatically extracted facial expressions of emotion and impressions of Big-Five personality traits in YouTube vlogs (i.e., video blogs).
method_label: We use the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT) system to characterize users of conversational vlogs.
method_label: From CERT temporal signals corresponding to instantaneously recognized facial expression categories, we propose and derive four sets of behavioral cues that characterize face statistics and dynamics in a compact way.
method_label: The cue sets are first used in a correlation analysis to assess the relevance of each facial expression of emotion with respect to Big-Five impressions obtained from crowd-observers watching vlogs, and also as features for automatic personality impression prediction.
result_label: Using a dataset of 281 vloggers, the study shows that while multiple facial expression cues have significant correlation with several of the Big-Five traits, they are only able to significantly predict Extraversion impressions with moderate values of R2.

TITLE: Estimating Causal Effects of Tone in Online Debates
ABSTRACT: background_label: Statistical methods applied to social media posts shed light on the dynamics of online dialogue.
background_label: For example, users' wording choices predict their persuasiveness and users adopt the language patterns of other dialogue participants.
objective_label: In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of reply tones in debates on linguistic and sentiment changes in subsequent responses.
method_label: The challenge for this estimation is that a reply's tone and subsequent responses are confounded by the users' ideologies on the debate topic and their emotions.
method_label: To overcome this challenge, we learn representations of ideology using generative models of text.
method_label: We study debates from 4Forums and compare annotated tones of replying such as emotional versus factual, or reasonable versus attacking.
method_label: We show that our latent confounder representation reduces bias in ATE estimation.
result_label: Our results suggest that factual and asserting tones affect dialogue and provide a methodology for estimating causal effects from text.

TITLE: How does emotional content affect lexical processing?
ABSTRACT: background_label: Even single words in isolation can evoke emotional reactions, but the mechanisms by which emotion is involved in automatic lexical processing are unclear.
background_label: Previous studies using extremely similar materials and methods have yielded apparently incompatible patterns of results.
background_label: In much previous work, however, words' emotional content is entangled with other non-emotional characteristics such as frequency of occurrence, familiarity and age of acquisition, all of which have potential consequences for lexical processing themselves.
method_label: In the present study, the authors compare different models of emotion using the British Lexicon Project, a large-scale freely available lexical decision database.
method_label: After controlling for the potentially confounding effects of non-emotional variables, a variety of statistical approaches revealed that emotional words, whether positive or negative, are processed faster than neutral words.
result_label: This effect appears to be categorical rather than graded; is not modulated by emotional arousal; and is not limited to words explicitly referring to emotions.
result_label: The authors suggest that emotional connotations facilitate processing due to the grounding of words' meanings in emotional experience.

TITLE: Annotating and Identifying Emotions in Text
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
objective_label: This paper focuses on the classification of emotions and polarity in news headlines and it is meant as an exploration of the connection between emotions and lexical semantics.
method_label: We first describe the construction of the data set used in evaluation exercise "Affective Text" task at SEMEVAL 2007, annotated for six basic emotions: ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, JOY, SADNESS and SURPRISE, and for POSI-TIVE and NEGATIVE polarity.
method_label: We also briefly describe the participating systems and their results.
result_label: Second, exploiting the same data set, we propose and evaluate several knowledge-based and corpus-based methods for the automatic identification of emotions in text.

TITLE: Online Harassment, Defamation, and Hateful Speech: A Primer of the Legal Landscape
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This interdisciplinary project focused on online speech directed at women and seeks to provide a primer on (i) what legal remedies, if any, are available for victims of sexist, misogynist, or harassing online speech, and (ii) if such legal remedies and procedures exist, whether practical hurdles stand in the way of victims’ abilities to stop harassing or defamatory behavior and to obtain legal relief.
background_label: The study concluded that while online harassment and hateful speech is a significant problem, there are few legal remedies for victims.
background_label: This is partly due to issues of jurisdiction and anonymity, partly due to the protection of internet speech under the First Amendment, and partly due to the lack of expertise and resources on online speech at various levels of law enforcement.
result_label: Given this landscape, the problem of online harassment and hateful speech is unlikely to be solved solely by victims using existing laws; law should be utilized in combination with other practical solutions.
objective_label: The objective of the project is to provide a resource that may be used by the general public, and in particular, researchers, legal practitioners, Internet community moderators, and victims of harassment and hateful speech online.

TITLE: Generalized Fact-Finding
ABSTRACT: background_label: Once information retrieval has located a document, and information extraction has provided its contents, how do we know whether we should actually believe it?
background_label: Fact-finders are a state-of-the-art class of algorithms that operate in a manner analogous to Kleinberg's Hubs and Authorities, iteratively computing the trustworthiness of an information source as a function of the believability of the claims it makes, and the believability of a claim as a function of the trustworthiness of those sources asserting it.
background_label: However, as fact-finders consider only "who claims what", they ignore a great deal of relevant background and contextual information.
method_label: We present a framework for "lifting" (generalizing) the fact-finding process, allowing us to elegantly incorporate knowledge such as the confidence of the information extractor and the attributes of the information sources.
result_label: Experiments demonstrate that leveraging this information significantly improves performance over existing, "unlifted" fact-finding algorithms.

TITLE: Negative Emotion in the Workplace: Employee Jealousy and Envy
ABSTRACT: background_label: Nine hypotheses were developed from the emerging literature on negative emotion in the workplace.
method_label: In order to test these hypotheses, the responses of 167 employed master's students to measures of individual differences (self-esteem and Machiavellianism), work unit attributes (autonomy, competitive reward, and supervisory considerateness) and personal response variables (sense of control, organization-based self-esteem, and propensity to quit) were analyzed with bivariate and hierarchical regression analyses.
result_label: Results of these analyses were generally supportive of the predicted relationships.
result_label: Findings are interpreted as indicating the utility of the constructs of employee jealousy and envy for understanding individual experiences of interpersonal stress.

TITLE: Verbal irony as implicit display of ironic environment: Distinguishing ironic utterances from nonirony
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Abstract This paper proposes an implicit display theory of verbal irony in order to provide a plausible explanation of how irony is distinguished from nonirony.
background_label: The implicit display theory claims that verbal irony is an utterance or a statement that implicitly displays ironic environment, a proper situational setting in the discourse context, and that verbal irony is a prototype-based category.
method_label: The notion of implicit display provides typicality conditions characterizing the prototype of verbal irony; the similarity between the prototype and an utterance is formulated as the degree of ironicalness.
method_label: In order for an utterance to be interpreted ironically, the utterance must be recognized as achieving implicit display through the process of assessing the degree of ironicalness, and the discourse situation must be identified as ironic environment through the process of checking or inferring its constituent events/states.
method_label: If these two criteria are satisfied, the utterance is judged to be ironic, otherwise it is judged to be non-ironic.
result_label: This paper also argues that the implicit display theory overcomes several difficulties of the existing irony studies and that it is consistent with the empirical findings from psycholinguistics.
result_label: These arguments indicate that the implicit display theory is a more adequate and comprehensive theory of verbal irony than the traditional pragmatic theory, the echoic interpretation theory, the pretense theory, and other theories.

TITLE: Context-aware Learning for Sentence-level Sentiment Analysis with Posterior Regularization
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper proposes a novel context-aware method for analyzing sentiment at the level of individual sentences.
background_label: Most existing machine learning approaches suffer from limitations in the modeling of complex linguistic structures across sentences and often fail to capture nonlocal contextual cues that are important for sentiment interpretation.
method_label: In contrast, our approach allows structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and global contextual information.
method_label: Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization.
method_label: The context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited.
result_label: Experiments on standard product review datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings.

TITLE: Fatal or not? Finding errors that lead to dialogue breakdowns in chat-oriented dialogue systems
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper aims to find errors that lead to dialogue breakdowns in chat-oriented dialogue systems.
method_label: We collected chat dialogue data, annotated them with dialogue breakdown labels, and collected comments describing the error that led to the breakdown.
method_label: By mining the comments, we first identified error types.
method_label: Then, we calculated the correlation between an error type and the degree of dialogue breakdown it incurred, quantifying its impact on dialogue breakdown.
result_label: This is the first study to quantitatively analyze error types and their effect in chat-oriented dialogue systems.

TITLE: Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques
ABSTRACT: background_label: We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative.
background_label: Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines.
method_label: However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization.
result_label: We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.

TITLE: Towards Detecting Counter-considerations in Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: Argumentation mining obviously involves finding support relations between statements, but many interesting instances of argumentation also contain counter-considerations, which the author mentions in order to preempt possible objections by the readers.
background_label: A counterconsideration in monologue text thus involves a switch of perspective toward an imaginary opponent.
method_label: We present a classification approach to classifying counter-considerations and apply it to two different corpora: a selection of very short argumentative texts produced in a text generation experiment, and a set of newspaper commentaries.
result_label: As expected, the latter pose more difficulties, which we investigate in a brief error anaylsis.

TITLE: Dimensions of Abusive Language on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper, we use a new categorical form of multidimensional register analysis to identify the main dimensions of functional linguistic variation in a corpus of abusive language, consisting of racist and sexist Tweets.
method_label: By analysing the use of a wide variety of parts-ofspeech and grammatical constructions, as well as various features related to Twitter and computer-mediated communication, we discover three dimensions of linguistic variation in this corpus, which we interpret as being related to the degree of interactive, antagonistic and attitudinal language exhibited by individual Tweets.
result_label: We then demonstrate that there is a significant functional difference between racist and sexist Tweets, with sexists Tweets tending to be more interactive and attitudinal than racist Tweets.

TITLE: Emotions from Text: Machine Learning for Text-based Emotion Prediction
ABSTRACT: background_label: In addition to information, text contains attitudinal, and more specifically, emotional content.
objective_label: This paper explores the text-based emotion prediction problem empirically, using supervised machine learning with the SNoW learning architecture.
objective_label: The goal is to classify the emotional affinity of sentences in the narrative domain of children's fairy tales, for subsequent usage in appropriate expressive rendering of text-to-speech synthesis.
result_label: Initial experiments on a preliminary data set of 22 fairy tales show encouraging results over a naive baseline and BOW approach for classification of emotional versus non-emotional contents, with some dependency on parameter tuning.
result_label: We also discuss results for a tripartite model which covers emotional valence, as well as feature set alternations.
result_label: In addition, we present plans for a more cognitively sound sequential model, taking into consideration a larger set of basic emotions.

TITLE: Reinforcement Learning Based Emotional Editing Constraint Conversation Generation
ABSTRACT: background_label: In recent years, the generation of conversation content based on deep neural networks has attracted many researchers.
background_label: However, traditional neural language models tend to generate general replies, lacking logical and emotional factors.
objective_label: This paper proposes a conversation content generation model that combines reinforcement learning with emotional editing constraints to generate more meaningful and customizable emotional replies.
method_label: The model divides the replies into three clauses based on pre-generated keywords and uses the emotional editor to further optimize the final reply.
method_label: The model combines multi-task learning with multiple indicator rewards to comprehensively optimize the quality of replies.
result_label: Experiments shows that our model can not only improve the fluency of the replies, but also significantly enhance the logical relevance and emotional relevance of the replies.

TITLE: Analyzing the Semantic Types of Claims and Premises in an Online Persuasive Forum
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractArgumentative text has been analyzed both theoretically and computationally in terms of argumentative structure that consists of argument components (e.g., claims, premises) and their argumentative relations (e.g., support, attack).
background_label: Less emphasis has been placed on analyzing the semantic types of argument components.
objective_label: We propose a two-tiered annotation scheme to label claims and premises and their semantic types in an online persuasive forum, Change My View, with the long-term goal of understanding what makes a message persuasive.
objective_label: Premises are annotated with the three types of persuasive modes: ethos, logos, pathos, while claims are labeled as interpretation, evaluation, agreement, or disagreement, the latter two designed to account for the dialogical nature of our corpus.We aim to answer three questions: 1) can humans reliably annotate the semantic types of argument components?
method_label: 2) are types of premises/claims positioned in recurrent orders?
result_label: and 3) are certain types of claims and/or premises more likely to appear in persuasive messages than in nonpersuasive messages?

TITLE: Cheap and Fast – But is it Good? Evaluating Non-Expert Annotations for Natural Language Tasks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Human linguistic annotation is crucial for many natural language processing tasks but can be expensive and time-consuming.
objective_label: We explore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web.
method_label: We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation.
method_label: For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers.
method_label: For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts.
method_label: We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks.
result_label: We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.

TITLE: Block Argumentation
ABSTRACT: background_label: We contemplate a higher-level bipolar abstract argumentation for non-elementary arguments such as: X argues against Ys sincerity with the fact that Y has presented his argument to draw a conclusion C, by omitting other facts which would not have validated C. Argumentation involving such arguments requires us to potentially consider an argument as a coherent block of argumentation, i.e.
background_label: an argument may itself be an argumentation.
objective_label: In this work, we formulate block argumentation as a specific instance of Dung-style bipolar abstract argumentation with the dual nature of arguments.
method_label: We consider internal consistency of an argument(ation) under a set of constraints, of graphical (syntactic) and of semantic nature, and formulate acceptability semantics in relation to them.
method_label: We discover that classical acceptability semantics do not in general hold good with the constraints.
result_label: In particular, acceptability of unattacked arguments is not always warranted.
method_label: Further, there may not be a unique minimal member in complete semantics, thus sceptic (grounded) semantics may not be its subset.
method_label: To retain set-theoretically minimal semantics as a subset of complete semantics, we define semi-grounded semantics.
result_label: Through comparisons, we show how the concept of block argumentation may further generalise structured argumentation.

TITLE: Psychology and morality of political extremists: evidence from Twitter language analysis of alt-right and Antifa
ABSTRACT: background_label: The recent rise of the political extremism in Western countries has spurred renewed interest in the psychological and moral appeal of political extremism.
background_label: Empirical support for the psychological explanation using surveys has been limited by lack of access to extremist groups, while field studies have missed psychological measures and failed to compare extremists with contrast groups.
method_label: We revisit the debate over the psychological and moral appeal of extremism in the U.S. context by analyzing Twitter data of 10,000 political extremists and comparing their text-based psychological constructs with those of 5000 liberal and 5000 conservative users.
result_label: The results reveal that extremists show a lower positive emotion and a higher negative emotion than partisan users, but their differences in certainty is not significant.
result_label: In addition, while left-wing extremists express more language indicative of anxiety than liberals, right-wing extremists express lower anxiety than conservatives.
result_label: Moreover, our results mostly lend support to Moral Foundations Theory for partisan users and extend it to the political extremists.
result_label: With the exception of ingroup loyalty, we found evidences supporting the Moral Foundations Theory among left- and right-wing extremists.
result_label: However, we found no evidence for elevated moral foundations among political extremists.

TITLE: Perceiving affective content in ambiguous visual stimuli: a component of emotional intelligence.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Emotional intelligence involves the accurate appraisal and expression of emotions in oneself and others and the regulation of emotion in a way that enhances living.
background_label: One aspect of emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize the consensually agreed upon emotional qualities of objects in the environment.
method_label: One hundred thirty-nine adults viewed 18 reproductions of faces, color swatches, and abstract designs and rated the emotional content of these visual stimuli.
method_label: Three scores were extracted, including consensual accuracy, amount, and range of emotion perceived.
result_label: These scores were compared with other aspects of emotional intelligence such as empathy and related to constructs such as alexithymia and neuroticism.
result_label: A general ability to perceive consensual emotional content in visual stimuli was found, and it was most strongly associated with the ability to respond empathically to others.

ABSTRACT: background_label: Advances in computing power, natural language processing, and digitization of text now make it possible to study a culture's evolution through its texts using a"big data"lens.
background_label: Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories and forming patterns that are meaningful to us.
method_label: Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,327 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core emotional arcs which form the essential building blocks of complex emotional trajectories.
method_label: We strengthen our findings by separately applying Matrix decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.
result_label: For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.

TITLE: Computational Argumentation Quality Assessment in Natural Language
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractResearch on computational argumentation faces the problem of how to automatically assess the quality of an argument or argumentation.
background_label: While different quality dimensions have been approached in natural language processing, a common understanding of argumentation quality is still missing.
objective_label: This paper presents the first holistic work on computational argumentation quality in natural language.
method_label: We comprehensively survey the diverse existing theories and approaches to assess logical, rhetorical, and dialectical quality dimensions, and we derive a systematic taxonomy from these.
method_label: In addition, we provide a corpus with 320 arguments, annotated for all 15 dimensions in the taxonomy.
result_label: Our results establish a common ground for research on computational argumentation quality assessment.

TITLE: Analyzing empathetic interactions based on the probabilistic modeling of the co-occurrence patterns of facial expressions in group meetings
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents a novel research framework for the estimation of emotional interactions produced between meeting participants.
background_label: The types of emotional interaction targeted in this paper are empathy, antipathy, and unconcern.
method_label: We define here emotional interaction as a brief contiguous event wherein a pair exchange emotional messages via verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
objective_label: As the key behaviors, we focus on facial expression and gaze, because their combination realizes the rapid and directed transmission of a large number of emotional messages.
method_label: We assume that there is a strong link between the emotional interaction and the participants' facial expressions that occur simultaneously with the type of the emotional interactions.
method_label: Based on this assumption, we build a probabilistic model that represents a hierarchical structure involving the emotional interactions, facial expressions and other behaviors including utterance and gaze direction.
method_label: Using this model, the type of emotional interaction is estimated from interpersonal gaze directions, facial expressions, and utterances.
method_label: Our estimation is based on the Bayesian approach, and uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to approximate joint posterior probability distributions of the emotional interaction and model parameters present within the observed data.
result_label: An experiment on four-party conversations demonstrates the promising effectiveness of the proposed method.

TITLE: An Analysis of Emotion Communication Channels in Fan Fiction: Towards Emotional Storytelling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Centrality of emotion for the stories told by humans is underpinned by numerous studies in literature and psychology.
background_label: The research in automatic storytelling has recently turned towards emotional storytelling, in which characters' emotions play an important role in the plot development.
background_label: However, these studies mainly use emotion to generate propositional statements in the form"A feels affection towards B"or"A confronts B".
background_label: At the same time, emotional behavior does not boil down to such propositional descriptions, as humans display complex and highly variable patterns in communicating their emotions, both verbally and non-verbally.
objective_label: In this paper, we analyze how emotions are expressed non-verbally in a corpus of fan fiction short stories.
method_label: Our analysis shows that stories written by humans convey character emotions along various non-verbal channels.
result_label: We find that some non-verbal channels, such as facial expressions and voice characteristics of the characters, are more strongly associated with joy, while gestures and body postures are more likely to occur with trust.
result_label: Based on our analysis, we argue that automatic storytelling systems should take variability of emotion into account when generating descriptions of characters' emotions.

TITLE: The role of practice in fact retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: Four experiments examined the relationship among massive practice, speed-up of memory retrieval, and the reduction of long-term memory interference.
background_label: All experiments employed a multiday fact recognition procedure.
background_label: Interference was varied by a fan manipulation: Concepts could appear in more than one fact (fan) or only one fact (no fan).
method_label: We found that fact retrieval speeds up as a power function of days of practice but that the number of daily repetitions beyond four produced little or no impact on reaction time.
result_label: In addition, interference decreased in proportion to the degree of practice but did not disappear even with 25 days of practice.
result_label: Practice on specific facts and practice on the general task had multiplicative effects in reducing recognition time.
result_label: Further, general task practice was found to decrease interference, suggesting that general central processes were speeding up.
result_label: Most but not all of these practice effects and their interactions with interference are predicted by the ACT* model of fact retrieval.

TITLE: Information density, Heaps' Law, and perception of factiness in news
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSeeking information online can be an exercise in time wasted wading through repetitive, verbose text with little actual content.
background_label: Some documents are more densely populated with factoids (fact-like claims) than others.
background_label: The densest documents are potentially the most efficient use of time, likely to include the most information.
background_label: Thus some measure of "factiness" might be useful to readers.
result_label: Based on crowdsourced ratings of the factual content of 806 online news articles, we find that after controlling for widely varying document length using Heaps' Law, a significant positive correlation exists between perceived factual content and relative information entropy.

TITLE: A word of advice: how to tailor motivational text messages based on behavior change theory to personality and gender
ABSTRACT: background_label: Developing systems that motivate people to change their behaviors, such as an exercise application for the smartphone, is challenging.
objective_label: One solution is to implement motivational strategies from existing behavior change theory and tailor these strategies to preferences based on personal characteristics, like personality and gender.
method_label: We operationalized strategies by collecting representative motivational text messages and aligning the messages to ten theory-based behavior change strategies.
method_label: We conducted an online survey with 350 participants, where the participants rated 50 of our text messages (each aligned to one of the ten strategies) on how motivating they found them.
result_label: Results show that differences in personality and gender relate to significant differences in the evaluations of nine out of ten strategies.
result_label: Eight out of ten strategies were perceived as either more or less motivating in relation to scores on the personality traits Openness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness.
result_label: Four strategies were perceived as more motivating by men than by women.
result_label: These findings show that personality and gender influence how motivational strategies are perceived.
result_label: We conclude that our theory-based behavior change strategies can be more motivating by tailoring them to personality and gender of users of behavior change systems.

TITLE: Joint Inference for Fine-grained Opinion Extraction
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThis paper addresses the task of finegrained opinion extraction -the identification of opinion-related entities: the opinion expressions, the opinion holders, and the targets of the opinions, and the relations between opinion expressions and their targets and holders.
background_label: Most existing approaches tackle the extraction of opinion entities and opinion relations in a pipelined manner, where the interdependencies among different extraction stages are not captured.
method_label: We propose a joint inference model that leverages knowledge from predictors that optimize subtasks of opinion extraction, and seeks a globally optimal solution.
result_label: Experimental results demonstrate that our joint inference approach significantly outperforms traditional pipeline methods and baselines that tackle subtasks in isolation for the problem of opinion extraction.

TITLE: Difficulty-level Modeling of Ontology-based Factual Questions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Semantics based knowledge representations such as ontologies are found to be very useful in automatically generating meaningful factual questions.
background_label: Determining the difficulty level of these system generated questions is helpful to effectively utilize them in various educational and professional applications.
background_label: The existing approaches for finding the difficulty level of factual questions are very simple and are limited to a few basic principles.
method_label: We propose a new methodology for this problem by considering an educational theory called Item Response Theory (IRT).
method_label: In the IRT, knowledge proficiency of end users (learners) are considered for assigning difficulty levels, because of the assumptions that a given question is perceived differently by learners of various proficiencies.
method_label: We have done a detailed study on the features (factors) of a question statement which could possibly determine its difficulty level for three learner categories (experts, intermediates and beginners).
method_label: We formulate ontology based metrics for the same.
method_label: We then train three logistic regression models to predict the difficulty level corresponding to the three learner categories.

TITLE: The Dynamics of Emotional Chats with Bots: Experiment and Agent-Based Simulations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Quantitative research of emotions in psychology and machine-learning methods for extracting emotion components from text messages open an avenue for physical science to explore the nature of stochastic processes in which emotions play a role, e.g., in human dynamics online.
objective_label: Here, we investigate the occurrence of collective behavior of users that is induced by chats with emotional Bots.
method_label: The Bots, designed in an experimental environment, are considered.
method_label: Furthermore, using the agent-based modeling approach, the activity of these experimental Bots is simulated within a social network of interacting emotional agents.
result_label: Quantitative analysis of time series carrying emotional messages by agents suggests temporal correlations and persistent fluctuations with clustering according to emotion similarity.

TITLE: Storylines for structuring massive streams of news
ABSTRACT: background_label: Stories are the most natural ways for people to deal with information about the changing world.
background_label: They provide an efficient schematic structure to order and relate events according to some explanation.
method_label: We describe (1) a formal model for representing storylines to handle streams of news and (2) a first implementation of a system that automatically extracts the ingredients of a storyline from news articles according to the model.
method_label: Our model mimics the basic notions from narratology by adding bridging relations to timelines of events in relation to a climax point.
method_label: We provide a method for defining the climax score of each event and the bridging relations between them.
method_label: We generate a JSON structure for any set of news articles to represent the different stories they contain and visualize these stories on a timeline with climax and bridging relations.
result_label: This visualization helps inspecting the validity of the generated structures.

TITLE: Liars and Saviors in a Sentiment Annotated Corpus of Comments to Political Debates
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe investigate the expression of opinions about human entities in user-generated content (UGC).
background_label: A set of 2,800 online news comments (8,000 sentences) was manually annotated, following a rich annotation scheme designed for this purpose.
method_label: We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony.
result_label: We also show that the recognition of human targets poses additional challenges on mining opinions from UGC, since they are frequently mentioned by pronouns, definite descriptions and nicknames.

TITLE: Optimization of Information-Seeking Dialogue Strategy for Argumentation-Based Dialogue System
ABSTRACT: background_label: Argumentation-based dialogue systems, which can handle and exchange arguments through dialogue, have been widely researched.
background_label: It is required that these systems have sufficient supporting information to argue their claims rationally; however, the systems often do not have enough of such information in realistic situations.
background_label: One way to fill in the gap is acquiring such missing information from dialogue partners (information-seeking dialogue).
background_label: Existing information-seeking dialogue systems are based on handcrafted dialogue strategies that exhaustively examine missing information.
method_label: However, the proposed strategies are not specialized in collecting information for constructing rational arguments.
background_label: Moreover, the number of system's inquiry candidates grows in accordance with the size of the argument set that the system deal with.
method_label: In this paper, we formalize the process of information-seeking dialogue as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for automatically optimizing a dialogue strategy.
method_label: By utilizing DRL, our dialogue strategy can successfully minimize objective functions, the number of turns it takes for our system to collect necessary information in a dialogue.
method_label: We conducted dialogue experiments using two datasets from different domains of argumentative dialogue.
result_label: Experimental results show that the proposed formalization based on MDP works well, and the policy optimized by DRL outperformed existing heuristic dialogue strategies.

TITLE: How the Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction, Not Engaged Argument
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2 million people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people.
background_label: Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called 50c party posts vociferously argue for the government’s side in political and policy debates.
background_label: As we show, this is also true of most posts openly accused on social media of being 50c.
background_label: Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime’s strategic objective in pursuing this activity.
objective_label: In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content.
method_label: We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year.
method_label: In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime’s strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues.
method_label: We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime.
result_label: We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of “common knowledge” and information control in authoritarian regimes.

TITLE: The Elusive Backfire Effect: Mass Attitudes’ Steadfast Factual Adherence
ABSTRACT: background_label: Can citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological attachments?
background_label: The “backfire effect,” described by Nyhan and Reifler (Polit Behav 32(2):303–330.
background_label: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2, 2010), says no: rather than simply ignoring factual information, presenting respondents with facts can compound their ignorance.
background_label: In their study, conservatives presented with factual information about the absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq became more convinced that such weapons had been found.
result_label: The present paper presents results from five experiments in which we enrolled more than 10,100 subjects and tested 52 issues of potential backfire.
result_label: Across all experiments, we found no corrections capable of triggering backfire, despite testing precisely the kinds of polarized issues where backfire should be expected.
result_label: Evidence of factual backfire is far more tenuous than prior research suggests.
result_label: By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their ideological commitments.

TITLE: Analysis and visualization of temporal changes in bloggers' activities and interests
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social media such as blogs and microblogs enable users to easily and rapidly publish information on their personal activities and interests.
background_label: They are considered to provide valuable information from the viewpoints of sociology, linguistics, and marketing.
objective_label: This paper proposes a novel system for analyzing temporal changes in the activities and interests of bloggers through a 3D visualization of phrase dependency structures in sentences.
method_label: We first extract events that represent bloggers' activities and interests through analyzing the phrase dependencies of sentences in a blog archive.
method_label: We roughly categorize the retrieved events according to the thematic roles (such as the experiencer, agent, and location) of the noun within the events, and then store them in a dependency database so that we can retrieve events that involve a given topic.
method_label: Second, we present a 3D visualization framework for exploring temporal changes in events related to a topic.
method_label: Our framework enables users to find events about a topic that appear within a specific timing, and drill down details of the events.
method_label: It also enables users to compare events with different timings and/or on multiple topics.
method_label: Moreover, it allows them to observe an overview of temporal changes in sets of events, and long-term changes in the frequency of events to assist users in finding trends.
result_label: We implement the proposed system on our own five-year blog archive that focused on Japanese, and we report the usefulness of our system by using various examples.

TITLE: A Microphotonic Astrocomb
ABSTRACT: background_label: One of the essential prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers.
background_label: It has already been realized that the large number of exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as calibration light sources.
background_label: A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers.
method_label: Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23.7 GHz.
method_label: This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer.
result_label: As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research.

TITLE: Argumentation Machines : New Frontiers in Argumentation and Computation
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Argumentation may be defined as the study of different aspects of (human) interactions whose objective is to reach a conclusion about the truth of a proposition or the adoption of a course of action.
background_label: The aspects in question include the argumentation interaction, which is typically a dialogue; the construction and presentation of arguments for or against a proposition; the interpretation of arguments; the knowledge representation required to build and interpret arguments; theory of rhetoric; and applications such as agent negotiation, legal argument, and decision-support systems.Argumentation is a rich interdisciplinary area of study, which so far has largely been considered separately by practitioners in different fields.
method_label: To address this problem, Reed and Norman brought together researchers in argumentation, artificial intelligence, law, linguistics, and philosophy, with the aim of writing a book about argumentation that would foster interdisciplinary work (see the book's Preface).The book comprises six chapters, each written by a different group of people, which cover diverse areas where argumentation has computational implications.
method_label: Chapter 1 introduces the book.
method_label: Chapters 2-4 consider argumentation in the context of multiagent, decision-support, and legal systems, focusing on rhetorical and representational issues that need to be taken into account when implementing such systems.
result_label: Chapters 5 and 6 address computational aspects of the implementation of argumentation systems.
background_label: As indicated in its Preface, the book distances itself from logical approaches to argumentation, and instead focuses on natural language interactions and conversational scenarios.
background_label: The six chapters of the book are outlined below.
background_label: ''A Roadmap of Research in Argument and Computation,'' by Reed and Norman, motivates the subsequent chapters and provides background on three main areas of research that are relevant to these chapters: artificial intelligence, rhetoric, and multiagent systems.
method_label: The discussion is supported by an extensive list of references (although there are some omissions).In ''Argument and Multi-agent Systems,'' by Norman, Carbogim, Krabbe, and Walton, the authors address issues at the intersection of argumentation and multiagent systems.
method_label: The discussion starts by contrasting argumentation theory with agent communication along two main dimensions: dialogue-structure/interaction-protocols, and beliefs/commitments.
method_label: The chapter then proceeds to describe different types of dialogue, argument schemas (Walton 1996) , and models of agent dialogue.

TITLE: Linguistic Understanding of Complaints and Praises in User Reviews
ABSTRACT: background_label: Traditional sentiment analysis has been focused on predicting the polarity of texts as positive or negative at different granularity.
background_label: This broad categorization does not account for informativeness of the underlying text.
background_label: For many real-world applications such as social listening, brand monitoring and e-commerce platforms, the opinions that really matter are the informative opinions describing why something is good or bad.
objective_label: In this paper, we try to understand the properties of complaints and praises which is an informative subset of the negative and positive categories.
result_label: Our analysis in the context of user reviews shows that complaints and praises have distinct properties that differentiate it from positive only or negative only sentences.

TITLE: Typefaces and the Perception of Humanness in Natural Language Chatbots
ABSTRACT: background_label: How much do visual aspects influence the perception of users about whether they are conversing with a human being or a machine in a mobile-chat environment?
objective_label: This paper describes a study on the influence of typefaces using a blind Turing test-inspired approach.
method_label: The study consisted of two user experiments.
method_label: First, three different typefaces (OCR, Georgia, Helvetica) and three neutral dialogues between a human and a financial adviser were shown to participants.
method_label: The second experiment applied the same study design but OCR font was substituted by Bradley font.
method_label: For each of our two independent experiments, participants were shown three dialogue transcriptions and three typefaces counterbalanced.
method_label: For each dialogue typeface pair, participants had to classify adviser conversations as human or chatbot-like.
result_label: The results showed that machine-like typefaces biased users towards perceiving the adviser as machines but, unexpectedly, handwritten-like typefaces had not the opposite effect.
result_label: Those effects were, however, influenced by the familiarity of the user to artificial intelligence and other participants' characteristics.

TITLE: Discovering Basic Emotion Sets via Semantic Clustering on a Twitter Corpus
ABSTRACT: background_label: A plethora of words are used to describe the spectrum of human emotions, but how many emotions are there really, and how do they interact?
background_label: Over the past few decades, several theories of emotion have been proposed, each based around the existence of a set of 'basic emotions', and each supported by an extensive variety of research including studies in facial expression, ethology, neurology and physiology.
objective_label: Here we present research based on a theory that people transmit their understanding of emotions through the language they use surrounding emotion keywords.
method_label: Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets, six of the basic emotion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC), evaluating the distinctiveness of the semantic meaning attached to the emotional label.
result_label: We hypothesise that the more distinct the language is used to express a certain emotion, then the more distinct the perception (including proprioception) of that emotion is, and thus more 'basic'.
background_label: This allows us to select the dimensions best representing the entire spectrum of emotion.
background_label: We find that Ekman's set, arguably the most frequently used for classifying emotions, is in fact the most semantically distinct overall.
method_label: Next, taking all analysed (that is, previously proposed) emotion terms into account, we determine the optimal semantically irreducible basic emotion set using an iterative LSC algorithm.
method_label: Our newly-derived set (Accepting, Ashamed, Contempt, Interested, Joyful, Pleased, Sleepy, Stressed) generates a 6.1% increase in distinctiveness over Ekman's set (Angry, Disgusted, Joyful, Sad, Scared).
result_label: We also demonstrate how using LSC data can help visualise emotions.
result_label: We introduce the concept of an Emotion Profile and briefly analyse compound emotions both visually and mathematically.

TITLE: Political Issue Extraction Model: A Novel Hierarchical Topic Model That Uses Tweets By Political And Non-Political Authors
ABSTRACT: background_label: People often use social media to discuss opinions, including political ones.
background_label: We refer to relevant topics in these discussions as political issues, and the alternate stands towards these topics as political positions.
method_label: We present a Political Issue Extraction (PIE) model that is capable of discovering political issues and positions from an unlabeled dataset of tweets.
method_label: A strength of this model is that it uses twitter timelines of political and non-political authors, and affiliation information of only political authors.
method_label: The model estimates word-specific distributions (that denote political issues and positions) and hierarchical author/group-specific distributions (that show how these issues divide people).
method_label: Our experiments using a dataset of 2.4 million tweets from the US show that this model effectively captures the desired properties (with respect to words and groups) of political discussions.
result_label: We also evaluate the two components of the model by experimenting with: (a) Use to alternate strategies to classify words, and (b) Value addition due to incorporation of group membership information.
result_label: Estimated distributions are then used to predict political affiliation with 68% accuracy.

TITLE: Explainable AI: Beware of Inmates Running the Asylum Or: How I Learnt to Stop Worrying and Love the Social and Behavioural Sciences
ABSTRACT: background_label: In his seminal book `The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy And How To Restore The Sanity' [2004, Sams Indianapolis, IN, USA], Alan Cooper argues that a major reason why software is often poorly designed (from a user perspective) is that programmers are in charge of design decisions, rather than interaction designers.
background_label: As a result, programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target audience, a phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'.
objective_label: This paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate.
method_label: While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended users.
result_label: But explainable AI is more likely to succeed if researchers and practitioners understand, adopt, implement, and improve models from the vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, and if evaluation of these models is focused more on people than on technology.
result_label: From a light scan of literature, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope to infuse more results from the social and behavioural sciences into explainable AI, and present some key results from these fields that are relevant to explainable AI.

TITLE: What matters, context or sentiment?: Analysing the influence of news in U.S. elections using Natural Language Processing
ABSTRACT: background_label: A key question in the analysis of collective social behaviour is related to know if and how mass media can influence public opinion.
objective_label: In this paper, we explore quantitatively the relation between a specific manifestation of public opinion and the intention to vote a given candidate, with the information related to the candidates in the Mass Media.
method_label: We analyse the political news articles related to the US presidential campaign during the year 2016, using techniques of natural language processing.
method_label: We applied recursive deep models for semantic composition over sentiment treebank to be able to detect the sentiment of sentences, and topic detection methods in order to characterise how media outlets get involved in the election coverage.
method_label: The results of the analysis were compared to the outcomes of political polls in order to know which of these two aspects of the information have more influence and if there exists any causal relationship between them.
result_label: Our results suggest that the sentiment content of the news by itself is not enough to understand the differences in the polls between both candidates (validating the popular quote"There is no such thing as bad publicity") but the topic coverage distribution does and the sentiment content discriminated by topic is consistent with these results.
result_label: In particular, we found that one topic (news related to Clinton's email scandal) is the more relevant in this analysis because it correlates negatively and shows a significant causal relation with the difference between Clinton and Trump in the polls and also explain the negative values of sentiment analysis in Fox News coverage.

TITLE: Identifying Agreement and Disagreement in Conversational Speech: Use of Bayesian Networks to Model Pragmatic Dependencies
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe a statistical approach for modeling agreements and disagreements in conversational interaction.
method_label: Our approach first identifies adjacency pairs using maximum entropy ranking based on a set of lexical, durational, and structural features that look both forward and backward in the discourse.
method_label: We then classify utterances as agreement or disagreement using these adjacency pairs and features that represent various pragmatic influences of previous agreement or disagreement on the current utterance.
result_label: Our approach achieves 86.9% accuracy, a 4.9% increase over previous work.

TITLE: Probabilistic argumentation systems
ABSTRACT: background_label: Different formalisms for solving problems of inference under uncertainty have been developed so far.
background_label: The most popular numerical approach is the theory of Bayesian inference [Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988].
background_label: More general approaches are the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence [Shafer, 1976], and possibility theory [Dubois and Prade, 1990], which is closely related to fuzzy systems.
background_label: For these systems computer implementations are available.
method_label: In competition with these numerical methods are different symbolic approaches.
result_label: Many of them are based on different types of non-monotonic logic.

ABSTRACT: background_label: In the task of question answering, Memory Networks have recently shown to be quite effective towards complex reasoning as well as scalability, in spite of limited range of topics covered in training data.
objective_label: In this paper, we introduce Factual Memory Network, which learns to answer questions by extracting and reasoning over relevant facts from a Knowledge Base.
method_label: Our system generate distributed representation of questions and KB in same word vector space, extract a subset of initial candidate facts, then try to find a path to answer entity using multi-hop reasoning and refinement.
result_label: Additionally, we also improve the run-time efficiency of our model using various computational heuristics.

TITLE: What's the Problem: Automatically Identifying Problematic Dialogues in DARPA Communicator Dialogue Systems
ABSTRACT: background_label: Spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access to information services from any phone.
background_label: Recently, spoken dialogue systems for widely used applications such as email, travel information, and customer care have moved from research labs into commercial use.
background_label: These applications can receive millions of calls a month.
method_label: This huge amount of spoken dialogue data has led to a need for fully automatic methods for selecting a subset of caller dialogues that are most likely to be useful for further system improvement, to be stored, transcribed and further analyzed.
result_label: This paper reports results on automatically training a Problematic Dialogue Identifier to classify problematic human-computer dialogues using a corpus of 1242 DARPA Communicator dialogues in the travel planning domain.
result_label: We show that using fully automatic features we can identify classes of problematic dialogues with accuracies from 67% to 89%.

TITLE: A Neural Dissociation within Language: Evidence that the Mental Dictionary Is Part of Declarative Memory, and that Grammatical Rules Are Processed by the Procedural System
ABSTRACT: background_label: Language comprises a lexicon for storing words and a grammar for generating rule-governed forms.
background_label: Evidence is presented that the lexicon is part of a temporal-parietalhnedial-temporal declarative memory system and that granlmatical rules are processed by a frontamasal-ganglia procedural system.
background_label: Patients produced past tenses of regular and novel verbs (looked and plagged), which require an -ed-suffixation rule, and irregular verbs (dug), which are retrieved from memory.
method_label: Word-finding difficulties in posterior aphasia, and the general declarative memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease, led to more errors with irregular than regular and novel verbs.
result_label: Grammatical difficulties in anterior aphasia, and the general impairment of procedures in Parkinson's disease, led to the opposite pattern.
result_label: In contrast to the Parkinson's patients, who showed sup pressed motor activity and rule use, Huntington's disease patients showed excess motor activity and rule use, underscoring a role for the basal ganglia in grammatical processing.

TITLE: Collective emotions online and their influence on community life
ABSTRACT: background_label: E-communities, social groups interacting online, have recently become an object of interdisciplinary research.
background_label: As with face-to-face meetings, Internet exchanges may not only include factual information but also emotional information - how participants feel about the subject discussed or other group members.
background_label: Emotions are known to be important in affecting interaction partners in offline communication in many ways.
background_label: Could emotions in Internet exchanges affect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects of the trajectory of e-communities?
method_label: The development of automatic sentiment analysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using text messages collected from the web.
result_label: It is not clear if emotions in e-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or if they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group activities.
background_label: We show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large scale as observed in 4 million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC forums.
method_label: To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the emotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar emotional valences.
method_label: The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it would be if emotions occurred at random.
method_label: Distributions for cluster lengths can be explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for consecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length.
result_label: For BBC forum threads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute average emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of emotion in messages fell during discussions.
result_label: Our results prove that collective emotional states can be created and modulated via Internet communication and that emotional expressiveness is the fuel that sustains some e-communities.

TITLE: Learning Lexico-Functional Patterns for First-Person Affect
ABSTRACT: background_label: Informal first-person narratives are a unique resource for computational models of everyday events and people's affective reactions to them.
background_label: People blogging about their day tend not to explicitly say I am happy.
background_label: Instead they describe situations from which other humans can readily infer their affective reactions.
background_label: However current sentiment dictionaries are missing much of the information needed to make similar inferences.
objective_label: We build on recent work that models affect in terms of lexical predicate functions and affect on the predicate's arguments.
method_label: We present a method to learn proxies for these functions from first-person narratives.
result_label: We construct a novel fine-grained test set, and show that the patterns we learn improve our ability to predict first-person affective reactions to everyday events, from a Stanford sentiment baseline of .67F to .75F.

ABSTRACT: background_label: FaCT (Fast Classification of Terminologies) is a Description Logic (DL) classifier which has been implemented as a test-bed for a sound and complete tableaux satisfiability/subsumption testing algorithm.
background_label: FaCT’s novelty lies in its relatively expressive logic and its highly optimised implementation of the tableaux algorithm.
background_label: iFaCT is an extension of FaCT that supports reasoning with inverse roles.
result_label: The resulting logic is particularly interesting as it no longer has the finite model property.

TITLE: Coherence and flexibility in dialogue games for argumentation
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThis article carries out a formal study of dialogue games for argumentation.
method_label: A formal framework for such games is proposed which imposes an explicit reply structure on dialogues, where each dialogue move either attacks or surrenders to some earlier move of the other participant.
method_label: The framework is flexible in several respects.
method_label: It allows for different underlying logics, alternative sets of locutions and more or less strict rules for when they are allowed.
method_label: In particular, it allows for varying degrees of coherence and flexibility when it comes to maintaining focus of a dialogue.
result_label: Its formal nature supports the study of formal properties of specific dialogue protocols, especially on how they respect the underlying logic.

TITLE: Social functionality of human emotion.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Answers to the question "What are human emotions for?"
background_label: have stimulated highly productive programs of research on emotional phenomena in psychology and neuroscience in the past decade.
background_label: Although a variety of functions have been proposed and examined at different levels of abstraction, what is undeniable is that when emotional processing is compromised, most things social go awry.
objective_label: In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted.
method_label: We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend.
method_label: Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest.
method_label: Behavioral and brain mechanisms supporting their successful occurrence are evaluated.
result_label: At the group level, group emotions and group-based emotions, two very different phenomena, are discussed, and mechanistic accounts are reviewed.

TITLE: Exploring (Dis-)Similarities in Emoji-Emotion Association on Twitter and Weibo
ABSTRACT: background_label: Emojis have gained widespread acceptance, globally and cross-culturally.
background_label: However, Emoji use may also be nuanced due to differences across cultures, which can play a significant role in shaping emotional life.
objective_label: In this paper, we a) present a methodology to learn latent emotional components of Emojis, b) compare Emoji-Emotion associations across cultures, and c) discuss how they may reflect emotion expression in these platforms.
method_label: Specifically, we learn vector space embeddings with more than 100 million posts from China (Sina Weibo) and the United States (Twitter), quantify the association of Emojis with 8 basic emotions, demonstrate correlation between visual cues and emotional valence, and discuss pairwise similarities between emotions.
result_label: Our proposed Emoji-Emotion visualization pipeline for uncovering latent emotional components can potentially be used for downstream applications such as sentiment analysis and personalized text recommendations.

TITLE: Life-iNet: A Structured Network-Based Knowledge Exploration and Analytics System for Life Sciences
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSearch engines running on scientific literature have been widely used by life scientists to find publications related to their research.
background_label: However, existing search engines in the life-science domain, such as PubMed, have limitations when applied to exploring and analyzing factual knowledge (e.g., disease-gene associations) in massive text corpora.
background_label: These limitations are mainly due to the problems that factual information exists as an unstructured form in text, and also keyword and MeSH term-based queries cannot effectively imply semantic relations between entities.
objective_label: This demo paper presents the Life-iNet system to address the limitations in existing search engines on facilitating life sciences research.
method_label: Life-iNet automatically constructs structured networks of factual knowledge from large amounts of background documents, to support efficient exploration of structured factual knowledge in the unstructured literature.
method_label: It also provides functionalities for finding distinctive entities for given entity types, and generating hypothetical facts to assist literaturebased knowledge discovery (e.g., drug target prediction).

TITLE: CNN- and LSTM-based Claim Classification in Online User Comments
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWhen processing arguments in online user interactive discourse, it is often necessary to determine their bases of support.
objective_label: In this paper, we describe a supervised approach, based on deep neural networks, for classifying the claims made in online arguments.
method_label: We conduct experiments using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) on two claim data sets compiled from online user comments.
method_label: Using different types of distributional word embeddings, but without incorporating any rich, expensive set of features, we achieve a significant improvement over the state of the art for one data set (which categorizes arguments as factual vs. emotional), and performance comparable to the state of the art on the other data set (which categorizes propositions according to their verifiability).
result_label: Our approach has the advantages of using a generalized, simple, and effective methodology that works for claim categorization on different data sets and tasks.

TITLE: How is Your Mood When Writing Sexist tweets? Detecting the Emotion Type and Intensity of Emotion Using Natural Language Processing Techniques
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online social platforms have been the battlefield of users with different emotions and attitudes toward each other in recent years.
background_label: While sexism has been considered as a category of hateful speech in the literature, there is no comprehensive definition and category of sexism attracting natural language processing techniques.
background_label: Categorizing sexism as either benevolent or hostile sexism is so broad that it easily ignores the other categories of sexism on social media.
method_label: Sharifirad S and Matwin S 2018 proposed a well-defined category of sexism including indirect harassment, information threat, sexual harassment and physical harassment, inspired from social science for the purpose of natural language processing techniques.
objective_label: In this article, we take advantage of a newly released dataset in SemEval-2018 task1: Affect in tweets, to show the type of emotion and intensity of emotion in each category.
method_label: We train, test and evaluate different classification methods on the SemEval- 2018 dataset and choose the classifier with highest accuracy for testing on each category of sexist tweets to know the mental state and the affectual state of the user who tweets in each category.
result_label: It is a nice avenue to explore because not all the tweets are directly sexist and they carry different emotions from the users.
result_label: This is the first work experimenting on affect detection this in depth on sexist tweets.
result_label: Based on our best knowledge they are all new contributions to the field; we are the first to demonstrate the power of such in-depth sentiment analysis on the sexist tweets.

TITLE: Automatic Factual Question Generation from Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: Texts with potential educational value are becoming available through the Internet (e.g., Wikipedia, news services).
background_label: However, using these new tests in classrooms introduces many challenges, one of which is that they usually lack practice exercises and assessments.
objective_label: Here, we address part of this challenge by automating the creation of specific type of assessment item.
objective_label: Specifically, we focus automatically generating factual WH questions.
objective_label: Our goal is to create an automated system that can take as input a text and produce as output questions for assessing a reader's knowledge of the information in the text.
method_label: The questions could then be presented to a teacher, who could select and revise the ones that he or she judges to be useful.
result_label: After introducing the problem, we describe some of the computational and linguistic challenges presented by factual question generation.
background_label: We then present an implemented system that leverages existing natural language processing techniques to address some of these challenges.
background_label: The system uses a combination or manually encoded transformation rules and a statistical question ranker trained on a tailored dataset of labeled system output.
method_label: We present experiments that evaluate individual components of the system as well as the system as a whole.
result_label: We found, among other things, that the question ranker roughly doubled the acceptability rate of top-ranked questions.
method_label: In a user study, we tested whether K-12 teachers could efficiently create factual questions by selecting and revising suggestions from the system.
method_label: Offering automatic suggestions reduced the time and effort spent by participants, though it also affected the types or questions that were created.
result_label: This research supports the idea that natural language processing can help teachers efficiently create instructional content.
result_label: It provides solutions to some of the major challenges in question generation and an analysis and better understanding of those that remain.

TITLE: Deep Feelings: A Massive Cross-Lingual Study on the Relation between Emotions and Virality
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article provides a comprehensive investigation on the relations between virality of news articles and the emotions they are found to evoke.
background_label: Virality, in our view, is a phenomenon with many facets, i.e.
background_label: under this generic term several different effects of persuasive communication are comprised.
method_label: By exploiting a high-coverage and bilingual corpus of documents containing metrics of their spread on social networks as well as a massive affective annotation provided by readers, we present a thorough analysis of the interplay between evoked emotions and viral facets.
method_label: We highlight and discuss our findings in light of a cross-lingual approach: while we discover differences in evoked emotions and corresponding viral effects, we provide preliminary evidence of a generalized explanatory model rooted in the deep structure of emotions: the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) circumplex.
result_label: We find that viral facets appear to be consistently affected by particular VAD configurations, and these configurations indicate a clear connection with distinct phenomena underlying persuasive communication.

TITLE: Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles: a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance.
background_label: This striking level of coordination is thought to have arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status.
background_label: But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to become a reflex?
method_label: We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imagined characters do).
result_label: Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus.
result_label: We also report suggestive preliminary findings on the effects of gender and other features; e.g., surprisingly, for articles, on average, characters adapt more to females than to males.

ABSTRACT: background_label: The importance of the new textual genres such as blogs or forum entries is growing in parallel with the evolution of the Social Web.
objective_label: This paper presents two corpora of blog posts in English and in Spanish, annotated according to the EmotiBlog annotation scheme.
method_label: Furthermore, we created 20 factual and opinionated questions for each language and also the Gold Standard for their answers in the corpus.
method_label: The purpose of our work is to study the challenges involved in a mixed fact and opinion question answering setting by comparing the performance of two Question Answering (QA) systems as far as mixed opinion and factual setting is concerned.
method_label: The first one is open domain, while the second one is opinion-oriented.
result_label: We evaluate separately the two systems in both languages and propose possible solutions to improve QA systems that have to process mixed questions.

ABSTRACT: background_label: We analyze 26.2 million comments published in Arabic language on Twitter, from July 2014 to January 2015, when ISIS' strength reached its peak and the group was prominently expanding the territorial area under its control.
method_label: By doing that, we are able to measure the share of support and aversion toward the Islamic State within the online Arab communities.
method_label: We then investigate two specific topics.
method_label: First, by exploiting the time-granularity of the tweets, we link the opinions with daily events to understand the main determinants of the changing trend in support toward ISIS.
result_label: Second, by taking advantage of the geographical locations of tweets, we explore the relationship between online opinions across countries and the number of foreign fighters joining ISIS.

TITLE: Multilingual Emotion Analysis and Recognition Based on Prosodic and Semantic Features
ABSTRACT: background_label: This chapter uses multilingual emotional speech as the research object, induces experimenters’ emotional states through noise simulations and watching videos, and establishes multilingual emotional speech database including Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and Russian.
method_label: This chapter also analyzes acoustic characteristics of multilingual speech signals in different emotional states, extracts prosodic parameters, compares acoustic characteristics of emotional speech in different languages, and concludes the general rule of emotional speech features.
method_label: In this chapter, Gaussian mixture model method is used separately to do emotion recognition experiments in which multilingual speech achieved is 80%.
method_label: At the same time, this chapter marks emotional vocabularies, extracts emotional keywords information of statements, combines prosodic features with semantic information, and recognizes emotional speech.
result_label: Finally, the experiment results show that emotion recognition rate with semantic information is about three percentage points higher than recognition rate with only prosodic features.

TITLE: "Factual"or"Emotional": Stylized Image Captioning with Adaptive Learning and Attention
ABSTRACT: background_label: Generating stylized captions for an image is an emerging topic in image captioning.
background_label: Given an image as input, it requires the system to generate a caption that has a specific style (e.g., humorous, romantic, positive, and negative) while describing the image content semantically accurately.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a novel stylized image captioning model that effectively takes both requirements into consideration.
method_label: To this end, we first devise a new variant of LSTM, named style-factual LSTM, as the building block of our model.
method_label: It uses two groups of matrices to capture the factual and stylized knowledge, respectively, and automatically learns the word-level weights of the two groups based on previous context.
method_label: In addition, when we train the model to capture stylized elements, we propose an adaptive learning approach based on a reference factual model, it provides factual knowledge to the model as the model learns from stylized caption labels, and can adaptively compute how much information to supply at each time step.
result_label: We evaluate our model on two stylized image captioning datasets, which contain humorous/romantic captions and positive/negative captions, respectively.
result_label: Experiments shows that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, without using extra ground truth supervision.

TITLE: "Mood contagion": the automatic transfer of mood between persons.
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The current studies aimed to find out whether a nonintentional form of mood contagion exists and which mechanisms can account for it.
background_label: In these experiments participants who expected to be tested for text comprehension listened to an affectively neutral speech that was spoken in a slightly sad or happy voice.
other_label: The authors found that (a) the emotional expression induced a congruent mood state in the listeners, (b) inferential accounts to emotional sharing were not easily reconciled with the findings, (c) different affective experiences emerged from intentional and nonintentional forms of emotional sharing, and (d) findings suggest that a perception-behavior link (T. L. Chartrand & J.
result_label: A. Bargh, 1999) can account for these findings, because participants who were required to repeat the philosophical speech spontaneously imitated the target person's vocal expression of emotion.

TITLE: AutoTutor and affective autotutor: Learning by talking with cognitively and emotionally intelligent computers that talk back
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor as examples of innovative 21st century interactive intelligent systems that promote learning and engagement.
background_label: AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors.
method_label: AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students' knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions.
method_label: The model is used to dynamically tailor the interaction toward individual students' zones of proximal development.
method_label: Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students' emotional states in addition to their cognitive states.
method_label: Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 30--60-minute interactions.
result_label: Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge.
method_label: In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor.
result_label: We conclude this article with our vision for future work on interactive and engaging intelligent tutoring systems.

TITLE: The Jingle and Jangle of Emotion Assessment: Imprecise Measurement, Casual Scale Usage, and Conceptual Fuzziness in Emotion Research
ABSTRACT: background_label: Although affective science has seen an explosion of interest in measuring subjectively experienced distinct emotional states, most existing self-report measures tap broad affect dimensions and dispositional emotional tendencies, rather than momentary distinct emotions.
background_label: This raises the question of how emotion researchers are measuring momentary distinct emotions in their studies.
method_label: To address this question, we reviewed the self-report measurement practices regularly used for the purpose of assessing momentary distinct emotions, by coding these practices as observed in a representative sample of articles published in Emotion from 2001–2011 (n = 467 articles; 751 studies; 356 measurement instances).
method_label: This quantitative review produced several noteworthy findings.
method_label: First, researchers assess many purportedly distinct emotions (n = 65), a number that differs substantially from previously developed emotion taxonomies.
method_label: Second, researchers frequently use scales that were not systematically developed, and that include items also used to measure at least 1 other emotion on a separate scale in a separate study.
result_label: Third, the majority of scales used include only a single item, and had unknown reliability.
result_label: Together, these tactics may create ambiguity regarding which emotions are being measured in empirical studies, and conceptual inconsistency among measures of purportedly identical emotions across studies.
result_label: We discuss the implications of these problematic practices, and conclude with recommendations for how the field might improve the way it measures emotions.

TITLE: The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: Differentiating Hostile and Benevolent Sexism
ABSTRACT: background_label: The authors present a theory of sexism formulated as ambivalence toward women and validate a corresponding measure, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI).
background_label: The ASI taps 2 positively correlated components of sexism that nevertheless represent opposite evaluative orientations toward women: sexist antipathy or Hostile Sexism (HS) and a subjectively positive ( for sexist men ) orientation toward women, Benevolent Sexism (BS).
method_label: HS and BS are hypothesized to encompass 3 sources of male ambivalence: Paternalism, Gender Differentiation, and Heterosexuality.
method_label: Six ASI studies on 2,250 respondents established convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity.
result_label: Overall ASI scores predict ambivalent attitudes toward women, the HS scale correlates with negative attitudes toward and stereotypes about women, and the BS scale (for nonstudent men only) correlates with positive attitudes toward and stereotypes about women.
result_label: A copy of the ASI is provided, with scoring instructions, as a tool for further explorations of sexist ambivalence.

TITLE: A CONSTRUCTIVIST VIEW OF EMOTION
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACT Traditionally, the emotions have been viewed from a biological perspective; that is, the emotions have been seen as genetically determined and relatively invariable responses.
background_label: The present chapter, by contrast, views the emotions as social constructions.
background_label: More precisely, the emotions are here defined as socially constituted syndromes or transitory social roles.
background_label: A role-conception does not deny the contribution of biological systems to emotional syndromes; it does, however, imply that the functional significance of emotional responses is to be found largely within the sociocultural system.
method_label: With regard to subjective experience, a person interprets his own behavior as emotional in much the same way that an actor interprets a role“with feeling.” This involves not only the monitoring of behavior (including feedback from physiological arousal, facial expressions, etc.
method_label: ), but also an understanding of how the emotional role fits into a larger“drama” written by society.
result_label: Some of the biological, personal, and situational factors that influence emotional behavior are also discussed.

TITLE: Weighted Argumentation Systems: A Tool for Merging Argumentation Systems
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we address the problem of merging argumentation systems (AS) in a multi-agent setting.
background_label: Each agent's system may be built from different sets of arguments and/or different interactions between these arguments.
background_label: The merging process must lead to solve conflicts between the agents and to identify ASs representing the knowledge of the group of agents.
method_label: Previous work [6] has proposed a two-step merging process in which conflicts about an interaction result in a new kind of interaction, called ignorance.
method_label: However, this merging process is computationally expensive, and does not provide a single resulting AS.
method_label: We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations by introducing a refinement of the ignorance relation under the form of a weighted attack.
method_label: Our merging process takes only one step and provides a single weighted AS, which is easy to compute.

TITLE: Emotional persistence in online chatting communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: How do users behave in online chatrooms, where they instantaneously read and write posts?
background_label: We analyzed about 2.5 million posts covering various topics in Internet relay channels, and found that user activity patterns follow known power-law and stretched exponential distributions, indicating that online chat activity is not different from other forms of communication.
method_label: Analysing the emotional expressions (positive, negative, neutral) of users, we revealed a remarkable persistence both for individual users and channels.
method_label: I.e.
method_label: despite their anonymity, users tend to follow social norms in repeated interactions in online chats, which results in a specific emotional"tone"of the channels.
method_label: We provide an agent-based model of emotional interaction, which recovers qualitatively both the activity patterns in chatrooms and the emotional persistence of users and channels.
result_label: While our assumptions about agent's emotional expressions are rooted in psychology, the model allows to test different hypothesis regarding their emotional impact in online communication.

TITLE: Abstract argumentation
ABSTRACT: objective_label: In this paper we explore the thesis that the role of argumentation in practical reasoning in general and legal reasoning in particular is to justify the use of defeasible rules to derive a conclusion in preference to the use of other defeasible rules to derive a conflicting conclusion.
background_label: The defeasibility of rules is expressed by means of non-provability claims as additional conditions of the rules.
method_label: We outline an abstract approach to defeasible reasoning and argumentation which includes many existing formalisms, including default logic, extended logic programming, non-monotonic modal logic and auto-epistemic logic, as special cases.
method_label: We show, in particular, that the ‘admissibility’ semantics for all these formalisms has a natural argumentation-theoretic interpretation and proof procedure, which seem to correspond well with informal argumentation.
method_label: In the admissibility semantics there is only one way for one argument to attack another, namely by undermining one of its non-provability claims.
result_label: In this paper, we show how other kinds of attack between arguments, specifically how rebuttal and priority attacks, can be reduced to the undermining of non-provability claims.

TITLE: Automatic Extraction of Opinion Propositions and their Holders
ABSTRACT: background_label: We identify a new task in the ongoing analysis of opinions: finding propositional opinions, sentential complements which for many verbs contain the actual opinion, rather than full opinion sentences.
objective_label: We propose an extension of semantic parsing techniques, coupled with additional lexical and syntactic features, that can produce labels for propositional opinions as opposed to other syntactic constituents.
method_label: We describe the annotation of a small corpus of 5,139 sentences with propositional opinion information, and use this corpus to evaluate our methods.
result_label: We also present results that indicate that the proposed methods can be extended to the related task of identifying opinion holders and associating them with propositional

TITLE: Eliciting User Food Preferences in terms of Taste and Texture in Spoken Dialogue Systems
ABSTRACT: background_label: Food preference varies from person to person and is not easy to verbalize.
objective_label: This study proposes a dialogue system that elicits the user's food preference through human-robot interaction.
method_label: First, as the default knowledge of the dialogue system, we determined the ingredients of each dish from a large-scale recipe database, and collected the taste and texture of each dish and its ingredients by analyzing a large number of Twitter messages.
method_label: Subsequently, the dialogue system asks questions to elicit the user's preferred taste/texture of the food by using the default knowledge base, while employing frame-based dialogue management.
method_label: Finally, we created a food vector space that represents the relationship between the dish names, ingredients, and taste/texture expressions.
result_label: We also discuss the possibility of using this vector space in dish recommendation.

TITLE: Neural Representations of Emotion Are Organized around Abstract Event Features
ABSTRACT: background_label: Research on emotion attribution has tended to focus on the perception of overt expressions of at most five or six basic emotions.
background_label: However, our ability to identify others' emotional states is not limited to perception of these canonical expressions.
background_label: Instead, we make fine-grained inferences about what others feel based on the situations they encounter, relying on knowledge of the eliciting conditions for different emotions.
objective_label: In the present research, we provide convergent behavioral and neural evidence concerning the representations underlying these concepts.
method_label: First, we find that patterns of activity in mentalizing regions contain information about subtle emotional distinctions conveyed through verbal descriptions of eliciting situations.
method_label: Second, we identify a space of abstract situation features that well captures the emotion discriminations subjects make behaviorally and show that this feature space outperforms competing models in capturing the similarity space of neural patterns in these regions.
result_label: Together, the data suggest that our knowledge of others' emotions is abstract and high dimensional, that brain regions selective for mental state reasoning support relatively subtle distinctions between emotion concepts, and that the neural representations in these regions are not reducible to more primitive affective dimensions such as valence and arousal.

TITLE: Conceptualising Religious Indifferences in Relation to Religion and Nonreligion
ABSTRACT: background_label: This introduction first, sketches the genesis of the notion ‘religious indifference’ from different theological debates.
background_label: Second, we illustrate its use in the social scientific debate on secularisation and modernity, highlighting some of the difficulties with defining and identifying indifferent populations.
method_label: On the base of a relational approach to nonreligion we further conceptualise religious indifference as lacking direct relationships with religion, but as positioned in relation to religious or more explicit nonreligious positions by relevant agents who render the lack of direct relationships to religion remarkable.
method_label: This perspective underscores the concepts’ entanglement with the scientific study of non/religion.
method_label: All this adds to conceptualising indifference as a symbolically powerful and contested concept.
result_label: We discuss ways of distinguishing between different forms of indifference and conclude this introduction by summarising the contributions to this volume.

TITLE: Shallow Semantic Reasoning from an Incomplete Gold Standard for Learner Language
ABSTRACT: background_label: We investigate questions of how to reason about learner meaning in cases where the set of correct meanings is never entirely complete, specifically for the case of picture description tasks (PDTs).
method_label: To operationalize this, we explore different models of representing and scoring non-native speaker (NNS) responses to a picture, including bags of dependencies, automatically determining the relevant parts of an image from a set of native speaker (NS) responses.
method_label: In more exploratory work, we examine the variability in both NS and NNS responses, and how different system parameters correlate with the variability.
result_label: In this way, we hope to provide insight for future system development, data collection, and investigations into learner language.

TITLE: Coarse-grained Argumentation Features for Scoring Persuasive Essays
ABSTRACT: background_label: Scoring the quality of persuasive essays is an important goal of discourse analysis, addressed most recently with highlevel persuasion-related features such as thesis clarity, or opinions and their targets.
objective_label: We investigate whether argumentation features derived from a coarse-grained argumentative structure of essays can help predict essays scores.
method_label: We introduce a set of argumentation features related to argument components (e.g., the number of claims and premises), argument relations (e.g., the number of supported claims) and typology of argumentative structure (chains, trees).
result_label: We show that these features are good predictors of human scores for TOEFL essays, both when the coarsegrained argumentative structure is manually annotated and automatically predicted.

TITLE: Speech emotion recognition using SVM with thresholding fusion
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper presents a methodology for emotion recognition from speech signals and textual information together to improve the confidence level of emotion classification by using the threshold fusion.
method_label: Some of acoustic features are extracted from the speech signal to analyze the characteristics and behavior of speech.
method_label: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used for recognition of the emotional states.
method_label: In this approach textual analysis of all emotions and emotional contents are manually defined and labeled.
method_label: Emotion intensity levels of all emotional content and emotional words are calculated.
method_label: The absolute emotional state is predicted from the acoustic features and textual contents using threshold based fusion.
result_label: Results obtained from proposed approach show that the accuracy of the combined system has been improved as compared to the two individual methodologies.

TITLE: Argumentation mining
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Argumentation mining aims to automatically detect, classify and structure argumentation in text.
background_label: Therefore, argumentation mining is an important part of a complete argumentation analyisis, i.e.
objective_label: understanding the content of serial arguments, their linguistic structure, the relationship between the preceding and following arguments, recognizing the underlying conceptual beliefs, and understanding within the comprehensive coherence of the specific topic.
method_label: We present different methods to aid argumentation mining, starting with plain argumentation detection and moving forward to a more structural analysis of the detected argumentation.
method_label: Different state-of-the-art techniques on machine learning and context free grammars are applied to solve the challenges of argumentation mining.
result_label: We also highlight fundamental questions found during our research and analyse different issues for future research on argumentation mining.

TITLE: Vicarious Learning: Effects of Overhearing Dialog and Monologue-like Discourse in a Virtual Tutoring Session:
ABSTRACT: background_label: In two experiments, students overheard two computer-controlled virtual agents discussing four computer literacy topics in dialog discourse and four in monologue discourse.
background_label: In Experiment 1, the virtual tutee asked a series of deep questions in the dialog condition, but only one per topic in the monologue condition in both studies.
method_label: In the dialog conditions of Experiment 2, the virtual tutee asked either deep questions, shallow questions, or made comments.
method_label: In a fourth “dialog” condition, the comments were spoken by the virtual tutor.
method_label: The discourse spoken by the virtual tutor was identical in the dialog and monologue conditions, except in the fourth dialog condition.
result_label: In both studies, learners wrote significantly more content and significantly more relevant content in the deep question condition than in the monologue condition.
result_label: No other differences were significant.
result_label: Results were discussed in terms of advanced organizers, schema theory, and discourse comprehension theory.

TITLE: Enquiring Minds: Early Detection of Rumors in Social Media from Enquiry Posts
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many previous techniques identify trending topics in social media, even topics that are not pre-defined.
background_label: We present a technique to identify trending rumors, which we define as topics that include disputed factual claims.
background_label: Putting aside any attempt to assess whether the rumors are true or false, it is valuable to identify trending rumors as early as possible.
background_label: It is extremely difficult to accurately classify whether every individual post is or is not making a disputed factual claim.
method_label: We are able to identify trending rumors by recasting the problem as finding entire clusters of posts whose topic is a disputed factual claim.
method_label: The key insight is that when there is a rumor, even though most posts do not raise questions about it, there may be a few that do.
result_label: If we can find signature text phrases that are used by a few people to express skepticism about factual claims and are rarely used to express anything else, we can use those as detectors for rumor clusters.
background_label: Indeed, we have found a few phrases that seem to be used exactly that way, including: "Is this true?
background_label: ", "Really?
background_label: ", and "What?".
background_label: Relatively few posts related to any particular rumor use any of these enquiry phrases, but lots of rumor diffusion processes have some posts that do and have them quite early in the diffusion.
method_label: We have developed a technique based on searching for the enquiry phrases, clustering similar posts together, and then collecting related posts that do not contain these simple phrases.
method_label: We then rank the clusters by their likelihood of really containing a disputed factual claim.
method_label: The detector, which searches for the very rare but very informative phrases, combined with clustering and a classifier on the clusters, yields surprisingly good performance.
result_label: On a typical day of Twitter, about a third of the top 50 clusters were judged to be rumors, a high enough precision that human analysts might be willing to sift through them.

TITLE: Identifying Dogmatism in Social Media: Signals and Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: We explore linguistic and behavioral features of dogmatism in social media and construct statistical models that can identify dogmatic comments.
method_label: Our model is based on a corpus of Reddit posts, collected across a diverse set of conversational topics and annotated via paid crowdsourcing.
method_label: We operationalize key aspects of dogmatism described by existing psychology theories (such as over-confidence), finding they have predictive power.
method_label: We also find evidence for new signals of dogmatism, such as the tendency of dogmatic posts to refrain from signaling cognitive processes.
result_label: When we use our predictive model to analyze millions of other Reddit posts, we find evidence that suggests dogmatism is a deeper personality trait, present for dogmatic users across many different domains, and that users who engage on dogmatic comments tend to show increases in dogmatic posts themselves.

TITLE: Social argumentation in online synchronous communication
ABSTRACT: background_label: The ability to argue well is a valuable skill for students in both formal and informal learning environments.
background_label: While many studies have explored the argumentative practices in formal environments and some researchers have developed tools to enhance the argumentative skills, the social argumentation that is occurring in informal spaces has yet to be broadly investigated.
background_label: The challenges associated with observing and capturing the interactions in authentic settings can be identified as the main reasons for this deficiency.
background_label: On the other hand, the advancements in information technologies and the way these improvements lift the barriers between school and afterschool settings present ways to eliminate these challenges.
method_label: To this end, this study utilizes a popular Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), World of Warcraft (WoW), which provides an authentic environment, to investigate the quality of argumentation in online synchronous communication without interfering with the substantial characteristics of the interaction.
result_label: The results of the study demonstrate the quality of argumentation skills that a group of adolescents are displaying in online synchronous WoW chat as well as the patterns that emerge from the interplay between a number of contextual variables including synchronicity, interest, and authenticity.

TITLE: Collective Stance Classification of Posts in Online Debate Forums
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online debate sites are a large source of informal and opinion-sharing dialogue on current socio-political issues.
background_label: Inferring users’ stance (PRO or CON) towards discussion topics in domains such as politics or news is an important problem, and is of utility to researchers, government organizations, and companies.
background_label: Predicting users’ stance supports identification of social and political groups, building of better recommender systems, and personalization of users’ information preferences to their ideological beliefs.
method_label: In this paper, we develop a novel collective classification approach to stance classification, which makes use of both structural and linguistic features, and which collectively labels the posts’ stance across a network of the users’ posts.
method_label: We identify both linguistic features of the posts and features that capture the underlying relationships between posts and users.
method_label: We use probabilistic soft logic (PSL) (Bach et al., 2013) to model post stance by leveraging both these local linguistic features as well as the observed network structure of the posts to reason over the dataset.
result_label: We evaluate our approach on 4FORUMS (Walker et al., 2012b), a collection of discussions from an online debate site on issues ranging from gun control to gay marriage.
result_label: We show that our collective classification model is able to easily incorporate rich, relational information and outperforms a local model which uses only linguistic information.

TITLE: Emotional Attachment Framework for People-Oriented Software
ABSTRACT: background_label: In organizational and commercial settings, people often have clear roles and workflows against which functional and non-functional requirements can be extracted.
background_label: However, in more social settings, such as platforms for enhancing social interaction, successful applications are driven more by using emotional engagement than functionality, and the drivers of user engagement are difficult to identify.
background_label: A key challenge is to understand people's emotional goals so that they can be incorporated into the design.
objective_label: This paper proposes a novel framework called the Emotional Attachment Framework, which is based on existing models and theories of emotional attachment.
objective_label: Its aim is to facilitate the process of getting a deeper insight into emotional goals in software engineering.
objective_label: To demonstrate the framework in use, emotional goals are elicited for a software application that aims to provide help for homeless people.
method_label: To measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique in this study, a series of evaluations are undertaken: a semi-controlled experiment, a comparison analysis, and domain expert and end-user evaluation.
result_label: The results indicate that the Emotional Attachment Framework has the potential to give better insight during analysis of emotional goals.

TITLE: Argumentation context systems: A framework for abstract group argumentation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract.
background_label: We introduce a modular framework for distributed abstract argumentation where the argumentation context, that is information about preferences among arguments, values, validity, reasoning mode (skeptical vs. credulous) and even the chosen semantics can be explicitly represented.
method_label: The framework consists of a collection of abstract argument systems connected via mediators.
method_label: Each mediator integrates information coming from connected argument systems (thereby handling conflicts within this information) and provides the context used in a particular argumentation module.
method_label: The framework can be used in different directions; e.g., for hierarchic argumentation as typically found in legal reasoning, or to model group argumentation processes.

TITLE: Lifelong and Interactive Learning of Factual Knowledge in Dialogues
ABSTRACT: background_label: Dialogue systems are increasingly using knowledge bases (KBs) storing real-world facts to help generate quality responses.
background_label: However, as the KBs are inherently incomplete and remain fixed during conversation, it limits dialogue systems' ability to answer questions and to handle questions involving entities or relations that are not in the KB.
objective_label: In this paper, we make an attempt to propose an engine for Continuous and Interactive Learning of Knowledge (CILK) for dialogue systems to give them the ability to continuously and interactively learn and infer new knowledge during conversations.
method_label: With more knowledge accumulated over time, they will be able to learn better and answer more questions.
result_label: Our empirical evaluation shows that CILK is promising.

TITLE: Identifying Argumentative Discourse Structures in Persuasive Essays
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we present a novel approach for identifying argumentative discourse structures in persuasive essays.
background_label: The structure of argumentation consists of several components (i.e.
background_label: claims and premises) that are connected with argumentative relations.
method_label: We consider this task in two consecutive steps.
method_label: First, we identify the components of arguments using multiclass classification.
method_label: Second, we classify a pair of argument components as either support or non-support for identifying the structure of argumentative discourse.
result_label: For both tasks, we evaluate several classifiers and propose novel feature sets including structural, lexical, syntactic and contextual features.
result_label: In our experiments, we obtain a macro F1-score of 0.726 for identifying argument components and 0.722 for argumentative relations.

TITLE: Music practice and participation for psychological well-being: A review of how music influences positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment.
ABSTRACT: background_label: In “Flourish,” Martin Seligman maintained that the elements of well-being consist of “PERMA: positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment.” Although the question of what constitutes human flourishing or psychological well-being has remained a topic of continued debate among scholars, it has recently been argued in the literature that a paradigmatic or prototypical case of human psychological well-being would largely manifest most or all of the aforementioned PERMA factors.
background_label: Further, in “A Neuroscientific Perspective on Music Therapy,” Stefan Koelsch also suggested that “Music therapy can have effects that improve the psychological and physiological health of individuals,” so it seems plausible that engaging in practices of music can positively contribute to one living a more optimally flourishing life with greater psychological well-being.
result_label: However, recent studies on music practice and participation have not yet been reviewed and integrated under the PERMA framework from positive...

TITLE: A machine learning approach to sentiment analysis in multilingual Web texts
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is a form of information extraction from text of growing research and commercial interest.
objective_label: In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French.
method_label: We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity.
method_label: We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products.
method_label: We learn and evaluate several classification models that can be configured in a cascaded pipeline.
result_label: We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set.
background_label: We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca.
background_label: 83% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features.
background_label: The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca.
result_label: 70 and 68% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns.
result_label: In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages.
result_label: A substantial part of the article investigates the role of active learning techniques for reducing the number of examples to be manually annotated.

TITLE: Argument Mining: Extracting Arguments from Online Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online forums are now one of the primary venues for public dialogue on current social and political issues.
background_label: The related corpora are often huge, covering any topic imaginable.
objective_label: Our aim is to use these dialogue corpora to automatically discover the semantic aspects of arguments that conversants are making across multiple dialogues on a topic.
objective_label: We frame this goal as consisting of two tasks: argument extraction and argument facet similarity.
method_label: We focus here on the argument extraction task, and show that we can train regressors to predict the quality of extracted arguments with RRSE values as low as .73 for some topics.
result_label: A secondary goal is to develop regressors that are topic independent: we report results of cross-domain training and domain-adaptation with RRSE values for several topics as low as .72, when trained on topic independent features.

TITLE: Who Feels What and Why? Annotation of a Literature Corpus with Semantic Roles of Emotions
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractMost approaches to emotion analysis in fictional texts focus on detecting the emotion expressed in text.
background_label: We argue that this is a simplification which leads to an overgeneralized interpretation of the results, as it does not take into account who experiences an emotion and why.
background_label: Emotions play a crucial role in the interaction between characters and the events they are involved in.
background_label: Until today, no specific corpora that capture such an interaction were available for literature.
objective_label: We aim at filling this gap and present a publicly available corpus based on Project Gutenberg, REMAN (Relational EMotion ANnotation), manually annotated for spans which correspond to emotion trigger phrases and entities/events in the roles of experiencers, targets, and causes of the emotion.
result_label: We provide baseline results for the automatic prediction of these relational structures and show that emotion lexicons are not able to encompass the high variability of emotion expressions and demonstrate that statistical models benefit from joint modeling of emotions with its roles in all subtasks.
result_label: The corpus that we provide enables future research on the recognition of emotions and associated entities in text.
result_label: It supports qualitative literary studies and digital humanities.
other_label: The corpus is available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/reman.

TITLE: Measuring Emotional Contagion in Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social media are used as main discussion channels by millions of individuals every day.
background_label: The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others.
background_label: A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network.
background_label: Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved.
method_label: Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using Twitter.
method_label: Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion).
background_label: We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets.
background_label: We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents.
method_label: We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce.
method_label: We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion.
result_label: Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions.
result_label: In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions.

TITLE: Analyzing Argumentative Discourse Units in Online Interactions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Argument mining of online interactions is in its infancy.
background_label: One reason is the lack of annotated corpora in this genre.
objective_label: To make progress, we need to develop a principled and scalable way of determining which portions of texts are argumentative and what is the nature of argumentation.
objective_label: We propose a two-tiered approach to achieve this goal and report on several initial studies to assess its potential.

TITLE: Recognizing Humor on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we present our work of humor recognition on Twitter, which will facilitate affect and sentimental analysis in the social network.
objective_label: The central question of what makes a tweet (Twitter post) humorous drives us to design humor-related features, which are derived from influential humor theories, linguistic norms, and affective dimensions.
method_label: Using machine learning techniques, we are able to recognize humorous tweets with high accuracy and F-measure.
method_label: More importantly, we single out features that contribute to distinguishing non-humorous tweets from humorous tweets, and humorous tweets from other short humorous texts (non-tweets).
method_label: This proves that humorous tweets possess discernible characteristics that are neither found in plain tweets nor in humorous non-tweets.
result_label: We believe our novel findings will inform and inspire the burgeoning field of computational humor research in the social media.

TITLE: The hardest words: Exploring the dialogue of suicide in the counselling process — A discourse analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Increasing suicide rates among specific groups of the population have led to the publication of suicide reduction targets and guidelines applicable to all mental health professionals, including counsellors.
background_label: It is now widely expected that mental health workers possess skills and knowledge in the assessment of suicide risk.
method_label: This research study used a discourse analysis approach to analyse 16 counselling transcripts generated from assessment interviews with suicidal ‘client actors’.
method_label: Clients generally only referred to suicide by metaphors.
method_label: Counsellors’ responses to suicidal clients were primarily reflective.
result_label: There was little evidence of a suicide risk assessment being undertaken in the counselling discourse.
result_label: Implications for suicidal clients, counsellors and the counselling profession are discussed and further areas for research highlighted.

TITLE: Identifying Sarcasm in Twitter: A Closer Look
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite.
method_label: We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author.
method_label: We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm.
result_label: We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine learning techniques and human judges on this task.
result_label: Perhaps unsurprisingly, neither the human judges nor the machine learning techniques perform very well.

TITLE: Mining Crowdsourced First Impressions in Online Social Video
ABSTRACT: background_label: While multimedia and social computing research have used crowdsourcing techniques to annotate objects, actions, and scenes in social video sites like YouTube, little work has addressed the crowdsourcing of personal and social traits in online social video or social media content in general.
objective_label: In this paper, we address the problems of (1) crowdsourcing the annotation of first impressions of video bloggers (vloggers) personal and social traits in conversational YouTube videos, and (2) mining the impressions with the goal of modeling the interplay of different vlogger facets.
method_label: First, we design a human annotation task to crowdsource impressions of vloggers that extends a tradition of studies of personality impressions with the addition of attractiveness and mood impressions.
method_label: Second, we propose a probabilistic framework using Topic Models to discover prototypical impressions that are data driven, and that combine multiple facets of vloggers.
method_label: Finally, we address the task of automatically predicting topic impressions using nonverbal and verbal content extracted from videos and comments.
result_label: Our study of 442 YouTube vlogs and 2,210 annotations collected in Mechanical Turk supports recent literature showing the feasibility to crowdsource interpersonal human impression with comparable quality to what is reported in social psychology research, and provides insights on the interplay among human first impressions.
result_label: We also show that topic models are useful to discover meaningful prototypical impressions that can be validated by humans, and that different topics can be predicted using different sources of information from vloggers' nonverbal and verbal content, as well as comments from the audience.

TITLE: The relationship between task difficulty and emotion in online computer programming tutoring (abstract only)
ABSTRACT: background_label: Emotion, or affect, plays a central role in learning.
background_label: In particular, promoting positive emotions throughout the learning process is important for students' motivation to pursue computer science and for retaining computer science students.
background_label: Positive emotions, such as engagement or enjoyment, may be fostered by timely individualized help.
background_label: Especially promising are interventions if the student is having difficulty completing a task.
result_label: Recognizing when a student is facing a complex task may better inform teachers or adaptive learning environments about the students' affective states, which in turn can inform instructional adaptations.
background_label: We approach this research goal by analyzing a data set of student facial videos from computer-mediated human tutorial sessions in Java programming.
method_label: Students and tutors interacted with a synchronized web-based development environment.
method_label: The tutorial sessions were divided into six lessons each with subtasks, and featured corresponding learning objectives for the students.
method_label: In post-hoc analysis, we identified "difficult" tasks by comparing the frequencies of student-tutor interaction and task behaviors such as running the program and the time to complete tasks.
method_label: Nonverbal behaviors, such as gesturing or postural shifting, were then compared with task difficulty.
result_label: Understanding such nonverbal behavior can inform individualized interventions, which may keep students engaged and foster greater learning gains.

TITLE: From humor recognition to irony detection: The figurative language of social media
ABSTRACT: background_label: ElsevierReyes Pérez, A.; Rosso, P.; Buscaldi, D. (2012)
objective_label: AbstractThe research described in this paper focuses on analyzing two playful domains of language: humor and irony, in order to identify key values components for their automatic processing.
objective_label: In particular, we focus on describing a model for recognizing these phenomena in social media, such as "tweets".
method_label: Our experiments are centered on five data sets retrieved from Twitter taking advantage of usergenerated tags, such as "#humor" and "#irony".
method_label: The model, which is based on textual features, is assessed on two dimensions: representativeness and relevance.
result_label: The results, apart from providing some valuable insights into the creative and figurative usages of language, are positive regarding humor, and encouraging regarding irony.

TITLE: Emotions and dialogue in a peer-production community: the case of Wikipedia
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents a large-scale analysis of emotions in conversations among Wikipedia editors.
objective_label: Our focus is on the emotions expressed by editors in talk pages, measured by using the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW).
background_label: We find evidence that to a large extent women tend to participate in discussions with a more positive tone, and that administrators are more positive than non-administrators.
background_label: Surprisingly, female non-administrators tend to behave like administrators in many aspects.
result_label: We observe that replies are on average more positive than the comments they reply to, preventing many discussions from spiralling down into conflict.
result_label: We also find evidence of emotional homophily: editors having similar emotional styles are more likely to interact with each other.
result_label: Our findings offer novel insights into the emotional dimension of interactions in peer-production communities, and contribute to debates on issues such as the flattening of editor growth and the gender gap.

TITLE: Bad News or Mad News? Sentiment Scoring of Negativity, Fear, and Anger in News Content
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article examines the prevalence and nature of negativity in news content.
background_label: Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, we examine roughly fifty-five thousand front-page news stories, comparing four different affect lexicons, one for general negativity, and three capturing different measures of fear and anger.
background_label: We show that fear and anger are distinct measures that capture different sentiments.
background_label: It may therefore be possible to separate out fear and anger in media content, as in psychology.
method_label: We also find that negativity is more strongly related to anger than to fear for each measure.
result_label: This result appears to be driven by a small number of foreign policy words in the anger dictionaries, rather than an indication that negativity in U.S. coverage reflects “anger.” We highlight the importance of tailoring lexicons to domains to improve construct validity when conducting dictionary-based automation.
result_label: Finally, we connect these results to existing work on the impact of emotion on political preferences and reasoning.

TITLE: The Language of Ageism: Why We Need to Use Words Carefully.
ABSTRACT: background_label: PURPOSE Language carries and conveys meaning which feeds assumptions and judgments that can lead to the development of stereotypes and discrimination.
objective_label: As a result, this study closely examined the specific language that is used to communicate attitudes and perceptions of aging and older adults.
method_label: DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a qualitative study of a twitter assignment for 236 students participating in a senior mentoring program.
method_label: Three hundred fifty-four tweets were qualitatively analyzed to explore language-based age discrimination using a thematic analytic approach.
result_label: RESULTS Twelve percent of the tweets (n = 43) were found to contain discriminatory language.
result_label: Thematic analysis of the biased tweets identified 8 broad themes describing language-based age discrimination: assumptions and judgments, older people as different, uncharacteristic characteristics, old as negative, young as positive, infantilization, internalized ageism, and internalized microaggression.
result_label: IMPLICATIONS The language of ageism is rooted in both explicit actions and implicit attitudes which make it highly complex and difficult to identify.
result_label: Continued examination of linguistic encoding is needed in order to recognize and rectify language-based age discrimination.

TITLE: A Corpus for Modeling User and Language Effects in Argumentation on Online Debating
ABSTRACT: background_label: Existing argumentation datasets have succeeded in allowing researchers to develop computational methods for analyzing the content, structure and linguistic features of argumentative text.
background_label: They have been much less successful in fostering studies of the effect of"user"traits -- characteristics and beliefs of the participants -- on the debate/argument outcome as this type of user information is generally not available.
method_label: This paper presents a dataset of 78, 376 debates generated over a 10-year period along with surprisingly comprehensive participant profiles.
result_label: We also complete an example study using the dataset to analyze the effect of selected user traits on the debate outcome in comparison to the linguistic features typically employed in studies of this kind.

method_label: The relationship of such gestures to the issue of compatibility is also discussed.
result_label: Finally, we suggest how to improve the use of grammar-based models in analysing and designing interaction languages.

TITLE: Analyzing the semantic content and persuasive composition of extremist media: A case study of texts produced during the Gaza conflict
ABSTRACT: background_label: While terrorism informatics research has examined the technical composition of extremist media, there is less work examining the content and intent behind such media.
objective_label: We propose that the arguments and issues presented in extremist media provide insights into authors’ intent, which in turn may provide an evidence-base for detecting and assessing risk.
method_label: We explore this possibility by applying two quantitative text-analysis methods to 50 online texts that incite violence as a result of the 2008/2009 Israeli military action in Gaza and the West Bank territories.
method_label: The first method—a content coding system that identifies the occurrence of persuasive devices—revealed a predominance of moral proof arguments within the texts, and evidence for distinguishable ‘profiles’ of persuasion use across different authors and different group affiliations.
method_label: The second method—a corpus-linguistic technique that identifies the core concepts and narratives that authors use—confirmed the use of moral proof to create an in-group/out-group divide, while also demonstrating a movement from general expressions of discontent to more direct audience-orientated expressions of violence as conflict heightened.
result_label: We conclude that multi-method analyses are a valuable approach to building both an evidence-based understanding of terrorist media use and a valid set of applications within terrorist informatics.

TITLE: The emotions that we perceive in music: the influence of language and lyrics comprehension on agreement
ABSTRACT: background_label: In the present study, we address the relationship between the emotions perceived in pop and rock music (mainly in Euro-American styles with English lyrics) and the language spoken by the listener.
objective_label: Our goal is to understand the influence of lyrics comprehension on the perception of emotions and use this information to improve Music Emotion Recognition (MER) models.
objective_label: Two main research questions are addressed: 1.
method_label: Are there differences and similarities between the emotions perceived in pop/rock music by listeners raised with different mother tongues?
method_label: 2.
other_label: Do personal characteristics have an influence on the perceived emotions for listeners of a given language?
method_label: Personal characteristics include the listeners' general demographics, familiarity and preference for the fragments, and music sophistication.
result_label: Our hypothesis is that inter-rater agreement (as defined by Krippendorff's alpha coefficient) from subjects is directly influenced by the comprehension of lyrics.

TITLE: What’s with the Attitude? Identifying Sentences with Attitude in Online Discussions
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractMining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing.
background_label: An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web.
background_label: Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums.
background_label: Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics.
method_label: In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another.
method_label: This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative.
method_label: This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links.
method_label: The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts.
result_label: The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.

TITLE: Happy Tweets: Christians Are Happier, More Socially Connected, and Less Analytical Than Atheists on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: We analyze data from nearly 2 million text messages (tweets) across over 16,000 users on Twitter to examine differences between Christians and atheists in natural language.
background_label: Analyses reveal that Christians use more positive emotion words and less negative emotion words than atheists.
result_label: Moreover, two independent paths predict differences in expressions of happiness: frequency of words related to an intuitive (vs. analytic) thinking style and frequency of words related to social relationships.
result_label: These findings provide the first evidence that the relationship between religion and happiness is partially mediated by thinking style.
result_label: This research also provides support for previous laboratory studies and self-report data, suggesting that social connection partially mediates the relationship between religiosity and happiness.
result_label: Implications for theory and the future of social science using computational methods to analyze social media are discussed.

TITLE: Towards Answering Opinion Questions: Separating Facts From Opinions And Identifying The Polarity Of Opinion Sentences
ABSTRACT: background_label: Opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing.
objective_label: In this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level.
method_label: We present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level.
method_label: We also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion.
result_label: Results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).

TITLE: Critical Argument and Writer Identity: Social Constructivism as a Theoretical Framework for EFL Academic Writing
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article makes the argument that we need to situate student's academic writing as socially constructed pieces of writing that embody a writer's cultural identity and critical argument.
background_label: In support, I present and describe a comprehensive model of an original English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing analytical framework.
objective_label: This article explains the interrelationship between the elements of cultural practices in academic discourse, writer identity, and critical thinking, and argues how this is influenced by the sociocultural values of academic discourse.
result_label: This interrelationship is realized by viewing EFL writing through a social constructivist lens, showing how critical thinking processes are shaped by awareness of the sociocultural conventions of academic discourse, and how critical thinking arises from a writer identity aligned with the culture of English academic writing.

ABSTRACT: objective_label: In this paper, we propose a self-attentive bidirectional long short-term memory (SA-BiLSTM) network to predict multiple emotions for the EmotionX challenge.
method_label: The BiLSTM exhibits the power of modeling the word dependencies, and extracting the most relevant features for emotion classification.
method_label: Building on top of BiLSTM, the self-attentive network can model the contextual dependencies between utterances which are helpful for classifying the ambiguous emotions.
result_label: We achieve 59.6 and 55.0 unweighted accuracy scores in the \textit{Friends} and the \textit{EmotionPush} test sets, respectively.

background_label: We argue that modal logics are particularly adapted to represent agents’ mental attitudes and to reason about them, and use a specific modal logic that we call Logic of Emotions in order to provide logical definitions of all but two of their 22 emotions.
result_label: While these definitions may be subject to debate, we show that they allow to reason about emotions and to draw interesting conclusions from the theory.

TITLE: Crime and punishment: Distinguishing the roles of causal and intentional analyses in moral judgment
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent research in moral psychology has attempted to characterize patterns of moral judgments of actions in terms of the causal and intentional properties of those actions.
background_label: The present study directly compares the roles of consequence, causation, belief and desire in determining moral judgments.
method_label: Judgments of the wrongness or permissibility of action were found to rely principally on the mental states of an agent, while judgments of blame and punishment are found to rely jointly on mental states and the causal connection of an agent to a harmful consequence.
background_label: Also, selectively for judgments of punishment and blame, people who attempt but fail to cause harm more are judged more leniently if the harm occurs by independent means than if the harm does not occur at all.
result_label: An account of these phenomena is proposed that distinguishes two processes of moral judgment: one which begins with harmful consequences and seeks a causally responsible agent, and the other which begins with an action and analyzes the mental states responsible for that action.

TITLE: Workgroup emotional intelligence: Scale development and relationship to team process effectiveness and goal focus.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Over the last decade, ambitious claims have been made in the management literature about the contribution of emotional intelligence to success and performance.
background_label: Writers in this genre have predicted that individuals with high emotional intelligence perform better in all aspects of management.
objective_label: This paper outlines the development of a new emotional intelligence measure, the Workgroup Emotional Intelligence Profile, Version 3 (WEIP-3), which was designed specifically to profile the emotional intelligence of individuals in work teams.
method_label: We applied the scale in a study of the link between emotional intelligence and two measures of team performance: team process effectiveness and team goal focus.
result_label: The results suggest that the average level of emotional intelligence of team members, as measured by the WEIP-3, is reflected in the initial performance of teams.
result_label: In our study, low emotional intelligence teams initially performed at a lower level than the high emotional intelligence teams.
result_label: Over time, however, teams with low average emotional intelligence raised their performance to match that of teams with high emotional intelligence.

TITLE: Connotation Frames: A Data-Driven Investigation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Through a particular choice of a predicate (e.g., "x violated y"), a writer can subtly connote a range of implied sentiments and presupposed facts about the entities x and y: (1) writer's perspective: projecting x as an "antagonist"and y as a "victim", (2) entities' perspective: y probably dislikes x, (3) effect: something bad happened to y, (4) value: y is something valuable, and (5) mental state: y is distressed by the event.
method_label: We introduce connotation frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of connotation using typed relations.
method_label: First, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments.
method_label: We then present models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their distributional word representations and the interplay between different types of connotative relations.
result_label: Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can be induced from various data sources that reflect how people use language and give rise to the connotative meanings.
result_label: We conclude with analytical results that show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in online news media.

TITLE: Emotional Dialogue Generation using Image-Grounded Language Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Computer-based conversational agents are becoming ubiquitous.
background_label: However, for these systems to be engaging and valuable to the user, they must be able to express emotion, in addition to providing informative responses.
background_label: Humans rely on much more than language during conversations; visual information is key to providing context.
method_label: We present the first example of an image-grounded conversational agent using visual sentiment, facial expression and scene features.
method_label: We show that key qualities of the generated dialogue can be manipulated by the features used for training the agent.
method_label: We evaluate our model on a large and very challenging real-world dataset of conversations from social media (Twitter).
result_label: The image-grounding leads to significantly more informative, emotional and specific responses, and the exact qualities can be tuned depending on the image features used.
result_label: Furthermore, our model improves the objective quality of dialogue responses when evaluated on standard natural language metrics.

TITLE: Emotion rating from short blog texts
ABSTRACT: background_label: Being able to automatically perceive a variety of emotions from text alone has potentially important applications in CMC and HCI that range from identifying mood from online posts to enabling dynamically adaptive interfaces.
background_label: However, such ability has not been proven in human raters or computational systems.
objective_label: Here we examine the ability of naive raters of emotion to detect one of eight emotional categories from 50 and 200 word samples of real blog text.
result_label: Using expert raters as a 'gold standard', naive-expert rater agreement increased with longer texts, and was high for ratings of joy, disgust, anger and anticipation, but low for acceptance and 'neutral' texts.
result_label: We discuss these findings in light of theories of CMC and potential applications in HCI.

TITLE: Emotional responses to irony and emoticons in written language: Evidence from EDA and facial EMG
ABSTRACT: background_label: While the basic nature of irony is saying one thing and communicating the opposite, it may also serve additional social and emotional functions, such as projecting humor or anger.
background_label: Emoticons often accompany irony in computer-mediated communication, and have been suggested to increase enjoyment of communication.
objective_label: In the current study, we aimed to examine online emotional responses to ironic versus literal comments, and the influence of emoticons on this process.
method_label: Participants read stories with a final comment that was either ironic or literal, praising or critical, and with or without an emoticon.
method_label: We used psychophysiological measures to capture immediate emotional responses: electrodermal activity to directly measure arousal and facial electromyography to detect muscle movements indicative of emotional expressions.
result_label: Results showed higher arousal, reduced frowning, and enhanced smiling for messages with rather than without an emoticon, suggesting that emoticons increase positive emotions.
result_label: A tendency toward less negative responses (i.e., reduced frowning and enhanced smiling) for ironic than literal criticism, and less positive responses (i.e., enhanced frowning and reduced smiling) for ironic than literal praise suggests that irony weakens the emotional impact of a message.
result_label: The present findings indicate the utility of a psychophysiological approach in studying online emotional responses to written language.

TITLE: Microblogging Sentiment Analysis Using Emotional Vector
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper proposes a new approach to analyze public moods on certain events in micro-blogging.
method_label: Combining with clinical psychology, we use emotional vector rather than traditional orientation to perform sentiment analysis.
method_label: The emotional vector could constantly absorb new Internet emotional words with our algorithm and has hierarchical structure so as to do multi-level analysis.
result_label: Experimental evaluations show that there is a strong correlation between bursty events and public moods, and sentiment analysis could implement effectively using the emotional vector proposed in this article.

TITLE: Identifying personality from the static, nonexpressive face in humans and chimpanzees: evidence of a shared system for signaling personality
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many aspects of personality are honestly signaled on the human face, as shown by accurate identification of personality traits from static images of unknown faces with neutral expressions.
background_label: Here, we examined the evolutionary history of this signal system.
method_label: In four studies, we found that untrained human observers reliably discriminated characteristics related to extraversion solely from nonexpressive facial images of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).
method_label: In chimpanzees, as in humans, there is therefore information in the static, nonexpressive face that signals aspects of an individual's personality.
result_label: We suggest that this performance is best explained by shared personality structure and signaling in the two species.

TITLE: Learning Representations of Emotional Speech with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Automatically assessing emotional valence in human speech has historically been a difficult task for machine learning algorithms.
background_label: The subtle changes in the voice of the speaker that are indicative of positive or negative emotional states are often"overshadowed"by voice characteristics relating to emotional intensity or emotional activation.
objective_label: In this work we explore a representation learning approach that automatically derives discriminative representations of emotional speech.
method_label: In particular, we investigate two machine learning strategies to improve classifier performance: (1) utilization of unlabeled data using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), and (2) multitask learning.
method_label: Within our extensive experiments we leverage a multitask annotated emotional corpus as well as a large unlabeled meeting corpus (around 100 hours).
result_label: Our speaker-independent classification experiments show that in particular the use of unlabeled data in our investigations improves performance of the classifiers and both fully supervised baseline approaches are outperformed considerably.
result_label: We improve the classification of emotional valence on a discrete 5-point scale to 43.88% and on a 3-point scale to 49.80%, which is competitive to state-of-the-art performance.

ABSTRACT: background_label: Translations between different nonmonotonic formalisms always have been an important topic in the field, in particular to understand the knowledge-representation capabilities those formalisms offer.
objective_label: We provide such an investigation in terms of different semantics proposed for abstract argumentation frameworks, a nonmonotonic yet simple formalism which received increasing interest within the last decade.
background_label: Although the properties of these different semantics are nowadays well understood, there are no explicit results about intertranslatability.
method_label: We provide such translations wrt.

TITLE: Dynamic Factual Summaries for Entity Cards
ABSTRACT: background_label: Entity cards are being used frequently in modern web search engines to offer a concise overview of an entity directly on the results page.
background_label: These cards are composed of various elements, one of them being the entity summary: a selection of facts describing the entity from an underlying knowledge base.
background_label: These summaries, while presenting a synopsis of the entity, can also directly address users' information needs.
objective_label: In this paper, we make the first effort towards generating and evaluating such factual summaries.
method_label: We introduce and address the novel problem of dynamic entity summarization for entity cards, and break it down to two specific subtasks: fact ranking and summary generation.
method_label: We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using crowdsourcing.
result_label: Our results show the effectiveness of our fact ranking approach and validate that users prefer dynamic summaries over static ones.

TITLE: Re-tweeting from a linguistic perspective
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWhat makes a tweet worth sharing?
method_label: We study the content of tweets to uncover linguistic tendencies of shared microblog posts (retweets), by examining surface linguistic features, deeper parse-based features and Twitterspecific conventions in tweet content.
method_label: We show how these features correlate with a functional classification of tweets, thereby categorizing people's writing styles based on their different intentions on Twitter.
method_label: We find that both linguistic features and functional classification contribute to re-tweeting.
result_label: Our work shows that opinion tweets favor originality and pithiness and that update tweets favor direct statements of a tweeter's current activity.
result_label: Judicious use of #hashtags also helps to encourage retweeting.

TITLE: Early words that work: When and how virtual linguistic mimicry facilitates negotiation outcomes
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract We hypothesized that in online, virtual formats, negotiators receive better outcomes when mimicking their counterpart's language; furthermore, we predicted that this strategy would be more effective when occurring early in the negotiation rather than at the end, and should also be effective across both independent and interdependent cultures.
result_label: Results from two experiments supported these hypotheses.
result_label: Experiment 1 was conducted in Thailand and demonstrated that negotiators who actively mimicked their counterpart's language in the first 10 min of the negotiation obtained higher individual gain compared to those mimicking during the last 10 min, as well as compared to control participants.
result_label: Experiment 2 replicated this effect in the United States (with Dutch and American negotiators) and also showed that trust mediated the effect of virtual linguistic mimicry on individual negotiation outcomes.
other_label: Implications for virtual communication, strategic mimicry, and negotiations are discussed.

TITLE: Narcissism and implicit attention seeking: Evidence from linguistic analyses of social networking and online presentation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Two studies examined how narcissism, a personality trait marked by self-promotion, vanity, and grandiosity, related to how people communicate information about themselves online.
background_label: We predicted that narcissists communicate in ways that draw attention to themselves.
method_label: Specifically, we predicted that narcissistic people who used relatively few first-person singular pronouns (e.g., ‘‘I,’’ and ‘‘me’’) would display more self-promoting and sexy images of themselves on their Facebook.com profile pages (Study 1) and would use more profane and aggressive words in an online self-descriptive task (Study 2).
result_label: Both studies supported this hypothesis.
other_label: Implications for narcissism and online communication research are discussed.

TITLE: Predicting personality with social behavior: a comparative study
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we study the problem of predicting personality with features based on social behavior.
background_label: While network position and text analysis are often used in personality prediction, the use of social behavior is fairly new.
background_label: Often studies of social behavior either concentrate on a single behavior or trait, or simply use behavior to predict ties that are then used in analysis of network position.
method_label: To study this problem, we introduce novel features based on a person’s social actions in general, towards specific individuals in particular.
method_label: We also compute the variation of these actions among all the social contacts of a person as well as the actions of friends.
method_label: We show that social behavior alone, without the help of any textual or network position information, provides a good basis for personality prediction.
result_label: We then provide a unique comparative study that finds the most significant features based on social behavior in predicting personality for three different communication mediums: Twitter, SMS and phone calls.
background_label: These mediums offer us with social behavior from public and private contexts, containing messaging and voice call type exchanges.
background_label: We find behaviors that are distinctive and normative among the ones we study.
method_label: We also illustrate how behavioral features relate to different personality traits.
method_label: We also show the various similarities and differences between different mediums in terms of social behavior.
method_label: Note that all behavioral features are based on statistical properties of the number and the time of social actions and do not consider the textual content.
result_label: As a result, they can be applied in many different settings.
result_label: Furthermore, our findings show us how behavioral features can be customized to a specific medium and personality trait.

TITLE: Who falls for fake news? The roles of bullshit receptivity, overclaiming, familiarity, and analytic thinking.
ABSTRACT: background_label: OBJECTIVE Fake news represents a particularly egregious and direct avenue by which inaccurate beliefs have been propagated via social media.
objective_label: We investigate the psychological profile of individuals who fall prey to fake news.
method_label: METHOD We recruited 1,606 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk for three online surveys.
method_label: RESULTS The tendency to ascribe profundity to randomly generated sentences-pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity-correlates positively with perceptions of fake news accuracy, and negatively with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news (media truth discernment).
method_label: Relatedly, individuals who overclaim their level of knowledge also judge fake news to be more accurate.
result_label: We also extend previous research indicating that analytic thinking correlates negatively with perceived accuracy by showing that this relationship is not moderated by the presence/absence of the headline's source (which has no effect on accuracy), or by familiarity with the headlines (which correlates positively with perceived accuracy of fake and real news).
result_label: CONCLUSION Our results suggest that belief in fake news may be driven, to some extent, by a general tendency to be overly accepting of weak claims.
result_label: This tendency, which we refer to as reflexive open-mindedness, may be partly responsible for the prevalence of epistemically suspect beliefs writ large.

TITLE: Sentiment analysis of informal textual communication in cyberspace
ABSTRACT: background_label: The ability to correctly identify the existence and polarity of emotion in informal, textual communication is a very important part of a realistic and immersive 3D environment where people communicate with one another through avatars or with an automated system.
background_label: Such a feature would provide the system the ability to realistically represent the mood and intentions of the participants, thus greatly enhancing their experience.
other_label: In this paper, we study and compare a number of approaches for detecting whether a textual utterance is of objective or subjective nature and in the latter case detecting the polarity of the utterance (i.e.
method_label: positive vs. negative).
result_label: Experiments are carried out on a real corpus of social exchanges in cyberspace and general conclusions are presented.

TITLE: Assessing The Factual Accuracy of Generated Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose a model-based metric to estimate the factual accuracy of generated text that is complementary to typical scoring schemes like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy).
method_label: We introduce and release a new large-scale dataset based on Wikipedia and Wikidata to train relation classifiers and end-to-end fact extraction models.
method_label: The end-to-end models are shown to be able to extract complete sets of facts from datasets with full pages of text.
result_label: We then analyse multiple models that estimate factual accuracy on a Wikipedia text summarization task, and show their efficacy compared to ROUGE and other model-free variants by conducting a human evaluation study.

TITLE: The relation between short-term emotion dynamics and psychological well-being: A meta-analysis.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Not only how good or bad people feel on average, but also how their feelings fluctuate across time is crucial for psychological health.
background_label: The last 2 decades have witnessed a surge in research linking various patterns of short-term emotional change to adaptive or maladaptive psychological functioning, often with conflicting results.
method_label: A meta-analysis was performed to identify consistent relationships between patterns of short-term emotion dynamics-including patterns reflecting emotional variability (measured in terms of within-person standard deviation of emotions across time), emotional instability (measured in terms of the magnitude of consecutive emotional changes), and emotional inertia of emotions over time (measured in terms of autocorrelation)-and relatively stable indicators of psychological well-being or psychopathology.
method_label: We determined how such relationships are moderated by the type of emotional change, type of psychological well-being or psychopathology involved, valence of the emotion, and methodological factors.
method_label: A total of 793 effect sizes were identified from 79 articles (N = 11,381) and were subjected to a 3-level meta-analysis.
result_label: The results confirmed that overall, low psychological well-being co-occurs with more variable (overall ρ̂ = -.178), unstable (overall ρ̂ = -.205), but also more inert (overall ρ̂ = -.151) emotions.
result_label: These effect sizes were stronger when involving negative compared with positive emotions.
result_label: Moreover, the results provided evidence for consistency across different types of psychological well-being and psychopathology in their relation with these dynamical patterns, although specificity was also observed.
result_label: The findings demonstrate that psychological flourishing is characterized by specific patterns of emotional fluctuations across time, and provide insight into what constitutes optimal and suboptimal emotional functioning.

TITLE: Image Retrieval by Emotional Semantics: A Study of Emotional Space and Feature Extraction
ABSTRACT: background_label: Image emotional semantic research is a promising and challenging issue.
objective_label: This paper analyzes the emotional space and builds a novel scheme that can annotate the image emotion semantic automatically and realize emotional image retrieval.
method_label: Based on psychological experiments evaluating evoked feelings for art paintings, we first identify an orthogonal three-dimension emotional factor space of images through 12 pairs of emotional words.
method_label: Then, the following three novel image features are designed for each emotional factor to predict it.
method_label: They are luminance-warm-cool fuzzy histogram, saturation-warm-cool fuzzy histogram integrated with color contrast and luminance contrast integrated with edge sharpness.
method_label: The values of emotional factors can be predicted from the image features automatically by using support vector machine of regression.
method_label: Finally, we design and implement an emotion-based image retrieval system, which enables the users to perform retrieval using emotional semantic words.
result_label: Experimental results show the effectiveness of our model.

TITLE: Curiosity and the pleasures of learning: Wanting and liking new information
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper proposes a new theoretical model of curiosity that incorporates the neuroscience of “wanting” and “liking”, which are two systems hypothesised to underlie motivation and affective experience for a broad class of appetites.
method_label: In developing the new model, the paper discusses empirical and theoretical limitations inherent to drive and optimal arousal theories of curiosity, and evaluates these models in relation to Litman and Jimerson's (2004) recently developed interest-deprivation (I/D) theory of curiosity.
result_label: A detailed discussion of the I/D model and its relationship to the neuroscience of wanting and liking is provided, and an integrative I/D/wanting-liking model is proposed, with the aim of clarifying the complex nature of curiosity as an emotional-motivational state, and to shed light on the different ways in which acquiring knowledge can be pleasurable.

TITLE: Perception of artificial agents and utterance friendliness in dialogue
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The present contribution investigates the construction of  dialogue structure for the use in human-machine interaction  especially for robotic systems and embodied conversational  agents.
objective_label: We are going to present a methodology and findings of a  pilot study for the design of task-specific dialogues.
method_label: Specifically, we investigated effects of dialogue complexity on  two levels: First, we examined the perception of the embodied  conversational agent, and second, we studied participants’  performance following HRI.
method_label: To do so, we manipulated the agent’s  friendliness during a brief conversation with the user in a  receptionist scenario.
method_label: The paper presents an overview of the dialogue system, the  process of dialogue construction, and initial evidence from an  evaluation study with naive users (N = 40).
method_label: These users  interacted with the system in a task-based dialogue in which they  had to ask for the way in a building unknown to them.
method_label: Afterwards  participants filled in a questionnaire.
result_label: Our findings show that  the users prefer the friendly version of the dialogue which  scored higher values both in terms of data collected via a  questionnaire and in terms of data collected during the run of  the experiment.
result_label: Implications of the present research for follow-up studies are  discussed, specifically focusing on the effects that dialogue  features have on agent perception and on the user’s evaluation  and performance.

TITLE: Telling ancient tales to modern machines: ontological representation of Sumerian literary narratives
ABSTRACT: background_label: This thesis examines the potential of semantic web technologies to support and complement scholarship in Assyriology.
background_label: Building on prior research, it is unique in its assessment of the suitability of three existing OWL ontologies (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, FRBRoo and Ontomedia) to adequately capture and represent the heterogeneous and incomplete narratives published as composites by the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
method_label: Its agenda sits firmly within the interdisciplinary context of the Digital Humanities and Web Science, and it describes a process centered on the development, implementation and valuation of an ontological representation system (mORSuL), designed to reflect the needs, desires, challenges and opportunities of Assyriological research paradigms.
method_label: Underlying the process are two fundamental assumptions: firstly, that semantic technologies can be used to support academic endeavours in the Humanities, and secondly, that the benefits of doing so can be identified and evaluated.
result_label: The thesis culminates in the conclusion that these existing ontologies are mostly suitable for the representation of the narrative content of these ancient texts, requiring only a few additions and changes.

background_label: This"iterated semi network-form game"framework has the following desirable characteristics: (1) Bounded rational players, (2) strategic players (i.e., players account for one another's reward functions when predicting one another's behavior), and (3) computational tractability even on real-world systems.
method_label: We achieve these benefits by combining concepts from game theory and reinforcement learning.
method_label: To be precise, we extend the bounded rational"level-K reasoning"model to apply to games over multiple stages.
method_label: Our extension allows the decomposition of the overall modeling problem into a series of smaller ones, each of which can be solved by standard reinforcement learning algorithms.
method_label: We call this hybrid approach"level-K reinforcement learning".
result_label: We investigate these ideas in a cyber battle scenario over a smart power grid and discuss the relationship between the behavior predicted by our model and what one might expect of real human defenders and attackers.

TITLE: Mimicry and expressiveness of an ECA in human-agent interaction: familiarity breeds content!
ABSTRACT: background_label: BACKGROUND Two experiments investigated the effect of features of human behaviour on the quality of interaction with an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA).
method_label: METHODS In Experiment 1, visual prominence cues (head nod, eyebrow raise) of the ECA were manipulated to explore the hypothesis that likeability of an ECA increases as a function of interpersonal mimicry.
method_label: In the context of an error detection task, the ECA either mimicked or did not mimic a head nod or brow raise that humans produced to give emphasis to a word when correcting the ECA's vocabulary.
method_label: In Experiment 2, presence versus absence of facial expressions on comprehension accuracy of two computer-driven ECA monologues was investigated.
result_label: RESULTS In Experiment 1, evidence for a positive relationship between ECA mimicry and lifelikeness was obtained.
result_label: However, a mimicking agent did not elicit more human gestures.
result_label: In Experiment 2, expressiveness was associated with greater comprehension and higher ratings of humour and engagement.
result_label: CONCLUSION Influences from mimicry can be explained by visual and motor simulation, and bidirectional links between similarity and liking.
result_label: Cue redundancy and minimizing cognitive load are potential explanations for expressiveness aiding comprehension.

TITLE: MSP-IMPROV: An Acted Corpus of Dyadic Interactions to Study Emotion Perception
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We present the MSP-IMPROV corpus, a multimodal emotional database, where the goal is to have control over lexical content and emotion while also promoting naturalness in the recordings.
background_label: Studies on emotion perception often require stimuli with fixed lexical content, but that convey different emotions.
background_label: These stimuli can also serve as an instrument to understand how emotion modulates speech at the phoneme level, in a manner that controls for coarticulation.
background_label: Such audiovisual data are not easily available from natural recordings.
objective_label: A common solution is to record actors reading sentences that portray different emotions, which may not produce natural behaviors.
method_label: We propose an alternative approach in which we define hypothetical scenarios for each sentence that are carefully designed to elicit a particular emotion.
method_label: Two actors improvise these emotion-specific situations, leading them to utter contextualized, non-read renditions of sentences that have fixed lexical content and convey different emotions.
method_label: We describe the context in which this corpus was recorded, the key features of the corpus, the areas in which this corpus can be useful, and the emotional content of the recordings.
method_label: The paper also provides the performance for speech and facial emotion classifiers.
result_label: The analysis brings novel classification evaluations where we study the performance in terms of inter-evaluator agreement and naturalness perception, leveraging the large size of the audiovisual database.

TITLE: Cognitive and Affective Benefits of an Animated Pedagogical Agent for Learning English as a Second Language
ABSTRACT: background_label: This study compared the use of ananimated pedagogical agent (agent) with an electronic arrow and voice narration (arrow and voice) in a multimedia learning environment where 74 college level English as a Second Language (ESL) students learned English relative clauses.
background_label: No significant differences in learning or performance were found between the group receiving the agent and the arrow and voice group.
method_label: This result provides evidence for Clark's (2001) claim that learning is supported by appropriate instructional methods (in this study directing attention to and voicing key concepts), not a delivery medium (in this study an animated agent or the drawing of an arrow with voice).
method_label: Clark has also argued against using expensive instructional media when lower cost alternatives achieve the same or similar learning and motivation goals.
result_label: It was also found that the agent's visual appearances and social behaviors did not motivate, interest, or tutor learners better than the simple arrow with voice.
result_label: Thus, this result does...

TITLE: Understanding the emotional labor process: a control theory perspective
ABSTRACT: background_label: A dynamic, process-oriented approach to understanding emotional labor is presented, utilizing concepts from control theory models of behavioral self-regulation.
method_label: Emotional labor is characterized as involving a discrepancy monitoring and reduction process, whereby perceptions of emotional displays and emotional display rules are continuously compared.
method_label: If a discrepancy between emotional displays and display rules is detected, individuals are proposed to use emotion regulation strategies to reduce the discrepancy.
method_label: The goal hierarchy aspect of control theory is used to describe emotional labor in the broader context of job performance and explain how positive and negative outcomes can result from the emotional labor process.
method_label: Propositions are developed throughout the paper.

TITLE: Recognizing strong and weak opinion clauses
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThere has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions and emotions in text.
objective_label: In this paper, we present the first experimental results classifying the intensity of opinions and other types of subjectivity and classifying the subjectivity of deeply nested clauses.
method_label: We use a wide range of features, including new syntactic features developed for opinion recognition.
method_label: We vary the learning algorithm and the feature organization to explore the effect this has on the classification task.
result_label: In 10-fold cross-validation experiments using support vector regression, we achieve improvements in mean-squared error over baseline ranging from 49% to 51%.
result_label: Using boosting, we achieve improvements in accuracy ranging from 23% to 96%.

TITLE: Interpreting ambiguous emotional expressions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Emotion expression is a complex process involving dependencies based on time, speaker, context, mood, personality, and culture.
background_label: Emotion classification algorithms designed for real-world application must be able to interpret the emotional content of an utterance or dialog given the modulations resulting from these and other dependencies.
background_label: Algorithmic development often rests on the assumption that the input emotions are uniformly recognized by a pool of evaluators.
background_label: However, this style of consistent prototypical emotion expression often does not exist outside of a laboratory environment.
method_label: This paper presents methods for interpreting the emotional content of non-prototypical utterances.
method_label: These methods include modeling across multiple time-scales and modeling interaction dynamics between interlocutors.
method_label: This paper recommends classifying emotions based on emotional profiles, or soft-labels, of emotion expression rather than relying on just raw acoustic features or categorical hard labels.
method_label: Emotion expression is both interactive and dynamic.
result_label: Consequently, to accurately recognize emotional content, these aspects must be incorporated during algorithmic design to improve classification performance.

TITLE: Using emotions to predict user interest areas in online social networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: We examine the relation between the emotions users express on social networks and their perceived areas of interests, based on a sample of Twitter users.
method_label: Our methodology relies on training machine learning models to classify the emotions expressed in tweets, according to Ekman's six high-level emotions.
method_label: We then used raters, sourced from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, to examine several Twitter profiles and to determine whether the profile owner is interested in various areas, including sports, movies, technology and computing, politics, news, economics, science, arts, health and religion.
result_label: We find that the propensity of a user to express various emotions correlates with their perceived degree of interest in various areas.
result_label: We present several models that use the emotional distribution of a Twitter user, as reflected by their tweets, to predict whether they are interested or disinterested in a topic or to determine their degree of interest in a topic.

TITLE: Integrating Non-Linguistic Events into Discourse Structure
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractInterpreting an utterance sometimes depends on the presence and nature of non-linguistic actions.
objective_label: In this paper, we motivate and develop a semantic model of embodied interaction in which the contribution that non-linguistic events make to the content of the interaction is dependent on their rhetorical connections to other actions, both linguistic and non-linguistic.
method_label: We support our claims with concrete examples from a corpus of online chats, comparing annotations of the linguistic-only content against annotations in which non-linguistic events in the context are taken into account.

TITLE: Finding Thoughtful Comments from Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTOnline user comments contain valuable user opinions.
background_label: Comments vary greatly in quality and detecting high quality comments is a subtask of opinion mining and summarization research.
background_label: Finding attentive comments that provide some reasoning is highly valuable in understanding the user's opinion particularly in sociopolitical opinion mining and aids policy makers, social organizations or government sectors in decision making.
objective_label: In this paper we study the problem of detecting thoughtful comments.
objective_label: We empirically study various textual features, discourse relations and relevance features to predict thoughtful comments.
method_label: We use logistic regression model and test on the datasets related to sociopolitical content.
method_label: We found that the most useful features include the discourse relations and relevance features along with basic textual features to predict the comment quality in terms of thoughtfulness.
result_label: In our experiments on two different datasets, we could achieve a prediction score of 79.37% and 73.47% in terms of F-measure on the two data sets, respectively.

TITLE: Emotion, Argumentation and Informal Logic
ABSTRACT: background_label: Over the past 60 years there have been tremendous advances made in Argumentation Theory.
background_label: One crucial advance has been the move from the investigation of static arguments to a concern with dialogic interactions in concrete contexts.
background_label: This focus has entailed a slow shift toward involving both non-logical and non-discursive elements in the analysis of an argument.
method_label: I argue that the traditional attitude Informal Logic has displayed toward emotion can be and ought be moderated.
result_label: In particular, I examine the role of emotion in everyday argumentation, and how Informal Logic can encompass it alongside the more traditional logical mode of communication

TITLE: Emotional Requirements in Video Games
ABSTRACT: background_label: Requirements engineering for video games must address a wide range of functional and non-functional requirements.
background_label: Video game designers are most concerned with capturing and representing the player experience: the means by which the player's consciousness is cognitively engaged while simultaneously inducing emotional responses.
method_label: We show that emotional requirements can be expressed in two parts: as the emotional intent of the designer and the means by which the designer expects to induce the target emotional state.
method_label: Spatial and temporal qualifiers on intent and means may also be required.
method_label: We introduce emotional terrain maps, emotional intensity maps, and emotion time lines as visual mechanisms for capturing and expressing emotional requirements.
result_label: Using a first-person shooter example, we show that these mechanisms can express the desired emotional requirements while providing support for spatial and temporal qualifiers

TITLE: Deliberative Discourse Idealized and Realized: Accountable Talk in the Classroom and in Civic Life
ABSTRACT: background_label: Classroom discussion practices that can lead to reasoned participation by all students are presented and described by the authors.
background_label: Their research emphasizes the careful orchestration of talk and tasks in academic learning.
objective_label: Parallels are drawn to the philosophical work on deliberative discourse and the fundamental goal of equipping all students to participate in academically productive talk.
background_label: These practices, termed Accountable TalkSM, emphasize the forms and norms of discourse that support and promote equity and access to rigorous academic learning.
method_label: They have been shown to result in academic achievement for diverse populations of students.
method_label: The authors outline Accountable Talk as encompassing three broad dimensions: one, accountability to the learning community, in which participants listen to and build their contributions in response to those of others; two, accountability to accepted standards of reasoning, talk that emphasizes logical connections and the drawing of reasonable conclusions; and, three, accountability to knowledge, talk that is based explicitly on facts, written texts, or other public information.
result_label: With more than fifteen years research into Accountable Talk applications across a wide range of classrooms and grade levels, the authors detail the challenges and limitations of contexts in which discourse norms are not shared by all members of the classroom community.

TITLE: Gender-Distinguishing Features in Film Dialogue
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractFilm scripts provide a means of examining generalized western social perceptions of accepted human behavior.
objective_label: In particular, we focus on how dialogue in films describes gender, identifying linguistic and structural differences in speech for men and women and in same and different-gendered pairs.
result_label: Using the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus (DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2012a), we identify significant linguistic and structural features of dialogue that differentiate genders in conversation and analyze how those effects relate to existing literature on gender in film.

TITLE: Are Some Tweets More Interesting Than Others? #HardQuestion
ABSTRACT: background_label: Twitter has evolved into a significant communication nexus, coupling personal and highly contextual utterances with local news, memes, celebrity gossip, headlines, and other microblogging subgenres.
background_label: If we take Twitter as a large and varied dynamic collection, how can we predict which tweets will be interesting to a broad audience in advance of lagging social indicators of interest such as retweets?
background_label: The telegraphic form of tweets, coupled with the subjective notion of interestingness, makes it difficult for human judges to agree on which tweets are indeed interesting.
method_label: In this paper, we address two questions: Can we develop a reliable strategy that results in high-quality labels for a collection of tweets, and can we use this labeled collection to predict a tweet's interestingness?
method_label: To answer the first question, we performed a series of studies using crowdsourcing to reach a diverse set of workers who served as a proxy for an audience with variable interests and perspectives.
method_label: This method allowed us to explore different labeling strategies, including varying the judges, the labels they applied, the datasets, and other aspects of the task.
method_label: To address the second question, we used crowdsourcing to assemble a set of tweets rated as interesting or not; we scored these tweets using textual and contextual features; and we used these scores as inputs to a binary classifier.
result_label: We were able to achieve moderate agreement (κ = 0.52) between the best classifier and the human assessments, a figure which reflects the challenges of the judgment task.

TITLE: Conceptual pacts and lexical choice in conversation
ABSTRACT: background_label: When people in conversation refer repeatedly to the same object, they come to use the same terms.
background_label: This phenomenon, called lexical entrainment, has several possible explanations.
background_label: Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features.
background_label: Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively.
method_label: Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to.
result_label: Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references.
result_label: Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.

TITLE: Psychological aspects of natural language. use: our words, our selves.
ABSTRACT: background_label: The words people use in their daily lives can reveal important aspects of their social and psychological worlds.
background_label: With advances in computer technology, text analysis allows researchers to reliably and quickly assess features of what people say as well as subtleties in their linguistic styles.
method_label: Following a brief review of several text analysis programs, we summarize some of the evidence that links natural word use to personality, social and situational fluctuations, and psychological interventions.
result_label: Of particular interest are findings that point to the psychological value of studying particles-parts of speech that include pronouns, articles, prepositions, conjunctives, and auxiliary verbs.
result_label: Particles, which serve as the glue that holds nouns and regular verbs together, can serve as markers of emotional state, social identity, and cognitive styles.
