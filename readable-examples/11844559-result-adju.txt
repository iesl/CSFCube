TITLE: Unsupervised Induction of Semantic Roles within a Reconstruction-Error Minimization Framework
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We introduce a new approach to unsupervised estimation of feature-rich semantic role labeling models.
method_label: Our model consists of two components: (1) an encoding component: a semantic role labeling model which predicts roles given a rich set of syntactic and lexical features; (2) a reconstruction component: a tensor factorization model which relies on roles to predict argument fillers.
result_label: When the components are estimated jointly to minimize errors in argument reconstruction, the induced roles largely correspond to roles defined in annotated resources.
result_label: Our method performs on par with most accurate role induction methods on English and German, even though, unlike these previous approaches, we do not incorporate any prior linguistic knowledge about the languages.

TITLE: Similarity-Driven Semantic Role Induction via Graph Partitioning
ABSTRACT: background_label: As in many natural language processing tasks, data-driven models based on supervised learning have become the method of choice for semantic role labeling.
background_label: These models are guaranteed to perform well when given sufficient amount of labeled training data.
background_label: Producing this data is costly and time-consuming, however, thus raising the question of whether unsupervised methods offer a viable alternative.
method_label: The working hypothesis of this article is that semantic roles can be induced without human supervision from a corpus of syntactically parsed sentences based on three linguistic principles: (1) arguments in the same syntactic position (within a specific linking) bear the same semantic role, (2) arguments within a clause bear a unique role, and (3) clusters representing the same semantic role should be more or less lexically and distributionally equivalent.
method_label: We present a method that implements these principles and formalizes the task as a graph partitioning problem, whereby argument instances of a verb are represented as vertices in a graph whose edges express similarities between these instances.
method_label: The graph consists of multiple edge layers, each one capturing a different aspect of argument-instance similarity, and we develop extensions of standard clustering algorithms for partitioning such multi-layer graphs.
result_label: Experiments for English and German demonstrate that our approach is able to induce semantic role clusters that are consistently better than a strong baseline and are competitive with the state of the art.

TITLE: Inducing Semantic Representation from Text by Jointly Predicting and Factorizing Relations
ABSTRACT: objective_label: In this work, we propose a new method to integrate two recent lines of work: unsupervised induction of shallow semantics (e.g., semantic roles) and factorization of relations in text and knowledge bases.
method_label: Our model consists of two components: (1) an encoding component: a semantic role labeling model which predicts roles given a rich set of syntactic and lexical features; (2) a reconstruction component: a tensor factorization model which relies on roles to predict argument fillers.
method_label: When the components are estimated jointly to minimize errors in argument reconstruction, the induced roles largely correspond to roles defined in annotated resources.
method_label: Our method performs on par with most accurate role induction methods on English, even though, unlike these previous approaches, we do not incorporate any prior linguistic knowledge about the language.

TITLE: Unsupervised Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: method_label: AbstractWe present an unsupervised method for labelling the arguments of verbs with their semantic roles.
method_label: Our bootstrapping algorithm makes initial unambiguous role assignments, and then iteratively updates the probability model on which future assignments are based.
method_label: A novel aspect of our approach is the use of verb, slot, and noun class information as the basis for backing off in our probability model.
result_label: We achieve 50-65% reduction in the error rate over an informed baseline, indicating the potential of our approach for a task that has heretofore relied on large amounts of manually generated training data.

TITLE: Cross-lingual Annotation Projection for Semantic Roles
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article considers the task of automatically inducing role-semantic annotations in the FrameNet paradigm for new languages.
objective_label: We propose a general framework that is based on annotation projection, phrased as a graph optimization problem.
objective_label: It is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to reduce the human effort involved in creating role-semantic resources.
method_label: Within this framework, we present projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic information.
result_label: We provide an experimental evaluation on an English-German parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing high-precision German semantic role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated English data.

TITLE: Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction via Split-Merge Clustering
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper we describe an unsupervised method for semantic role induction which holds promise for relieving the data acquisition bottleneck associated with supervised role labelers.
method_label: We present an algorithm that iteratively splits and merges clusters representing semantic roles, thereby leading from an initial clustering to a final clustering of better quality.
method_label: The method is simple, surprisingly effective, and allows to integrate linguistic knowledge transparently.
method_label: By combining role induction with a rule-based component for argument identification we obtain an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role labeling system.
result_label: Evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin.

TITLE: Joint Learning Improves Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Despite much recent progress on accurate semantic role labeling, previous work has largely used independent classifiers, possibly combined with separate label sequence models via Viterbi decoding.
background_label: This stands in stark contrast to the linguistic observation that a core argument frame is a joint structure, with strong dependencies between arguments.
method_label: We show how to build a joint model of argument frames, incorporating novel features that model these interactions into discriminative log-linear models.
result_label: This system achieves an error reduction of 22% on all arguments and 32% on core arguments over a state-of-the art independent classifier for gold-standard parse trees on PropBank.

TITLE: A generative model for semantic role labeling
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: Determining the semantic role of sentence constituents is a key task in determining sentence meanings lying behind a veneer of variant syntactic expression.
method_label: We present a model of natural language generation from semantics using the FrameNet semantic role and frame ontology.
method_label: We train the model using the FrameNet corpus and apply it to the task of automatic semantic role and frame identification, producing results competitive with previous work (about 70% role labeling accuracy).
result_label: Unlike previous models used for this task, our model does not assume that the frame of a sentence is known, and is able to identify nullinstantiated roles, which commonly occur in our corpus and whose identification is crucial to natural language interpretation.

TITLE: Unsupervised Argument Identification for Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: The task of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is often divided into two sub-tasks: verb argument identification, and argument classification.
background_label: Current SRL algorithms show lower results on the identification sub-task.
background_label: Moreover, most SRL algorithms are supervised, relying on large amounts of manually created data.
objective_label: In this paper we present an unsupervised algorithm for identifying verb arguments, where the only type of annotation required is POS tagging.
method_label: The algorithm makes use of a fully unsupervised syntactic parser, using its output in order to detect clauses and gather candidate argument collocation statistics.
result_label: We evaluate our algorithm on PropBank10, achieving a precision of 56%, as opposed to 47% of a strong baseline.
result_label: We also obtain an 8% increase in precision for a Spanish corpus.
result_label: This is the first paper that tackles unsupervised verb argument identification without using manually encoded rules or extensive lexical or syntactic resources.

TITLE: Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations.
background_label: Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model.
method_label: At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences.
method_label: We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference.
result_label: When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.

TITLE: Unsupervised Discovery Of A Statistical Verb Lexicon
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper demonstrates how unsupervised techniques can be used to learn models of deep linguistic structure.
objective_label: Determining the semantic roles of a verb's dependents is an important step in natural language understanding.
method_label: We present a method for learning models of verb argument patterns directly from unannotated text.
method_label: The learned models are similar to existing verb lexicons such as VerbNet and PropBank, but additionally include statistics about the linkings used by each verb.
method_label: The method is based on a structured probabilistic model of the domain, and unsupervised learning is performed with the EM algorithm.
result_label: The learned models can also be used discriminatively as semantic role labelers, and when evaluated relative to the PropBank annotation, the best learned model reduces 28% of the error between an informed baseline and an oracle upper bound.

TITLE: Distributed Representations for Unsupervised Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We present a new approach for unsupervised semantic role labeling that leverages distributed representations.
method_label: We induce embeddings to represent a predicate, its arguments and their complex interdependence.
method_label: Argument embeddings are learned from surrounding contexts involving the predicate and neighboring arguments, while predicate embeddings are learned from argument contexts.
method_label: The induced representations are clustered into roles using a linear programming formulation of hierarchical clustering, where we can model task-specific knowledge.
result_label: Experiments show improved performance over previous unsupervised semantic role labeling approaches and other distributed word representation models.

TITLE: Improving Implicit Semantic Role Labeling by Predicting Semantic Frame Arguments
ABSTRACT: background_label: Implicit semantic role labeling (iSRL) is the task of predicting the semantic roles of a predicate that do not appear as explicit arguments, but rather regard common sense knowledge or are mentioned earlier in the discourse.
method_label: We introduce an approach to iSRL based on a predictive recurrent neural semantic frame model (PRNSFM) that uses a large unannotated corpus to learn the probability of a sequence of semantic arguments given a predicate.
method_label: We leverage the sequence probabilities predicted by the PRNSFM to estimate selectional preferences for predicates and their arguments.
result_label: On the NomBank iSRL test set, our approach improves state-of-the-art performance on implicit semantic role labeling with less reliance than prior work on manually constructed language resources.

TITLE: Scaling up Automatic Cross-Lingual Semantic Role Annotation
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractBroad-coverage semantic annotations for training statistical learners are only available for a handful of languages.
background_label: Previous approaches to cross-lingual transfer of semantic annotations have addressed this problem with encouraging results on a small scale.
method_label: In this paper, we scale up previous efforts by using an automatic approach to semantic annotation that does not rely on a semantic ontology for the target language.
method_label: Moreover, we improve the quality of the transferred semantic annotations by using a joint syntacticsemantic parser that learns the correlations between syntax and semantics of the target language and smooths out the errors from automatic transfer.
result_label: We reach a labelled F-measure for predicates and arguments of only 4% and 9% points, respectively, lower than the upper bound from manual annotations.

TITLE: Semantic Role Labeling with Iterative Structure Refinement
ABSTRACT: background_label: Modern state-of-the-art Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) methods rely on expressive sentence encoders (e.g., multi-layer LSTMs) but tend to model only local (if any) interactions between individual argument labeling decisions.
background_label: This contrasts with earlier work and also with the intuition that the labels of individual arguments are strongly interdependent.
method_label: We model interactions between argument labeling decisions through {\it iterative refinement}.
method_label: Starting with an output produced by a factorized model, we iteratively refine it using a refinement network.
method_label: Instead of modeling arbitrary interactions among roles and words, we encode prior knowledge about the SRL problem by designing a restricted network architecture capturing non-local interactions.
result_label: This modeling choice prevents overfitting and results in an effective model, outperforming strong factorized baseline models on all 7 CoNLL-2009 languages, and achieving state-of-the-art results on 5 of them, including English.

TITLE: Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Induction
ABSTRACT: background_label: Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is an old and fundamental task in natural language processing.
background_label: While supervised POS taggers have shown promising accuracy, it is not always feasible to use supervised methods due to lack of labeled data.
objective_label: In this project, we attempt to unsurprisingly induce POS tags by iteratively looking for a recurring pattern of words through a hierarchical agglomerative clustering process.
result_label: Our approach shows promising results when compared to the tagging results of the state-of-the-art unsupervised POS taggers.

TITLE: A Bayesian Approach to Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe introduce two Bayesian models for unsupervised semantic role labeling (SRL) task.
background_label: The models treat SRL as clustering of syntactic signatures of arguments with clusters corresponding to semantic roles.
method_label: The first model induces these clusterings independently for each predicate, exploiting the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) as a prior.
method_label: In a more refined hierarchical model, we inject the intuition that the clusterings are similar across different predicates, even though they are not necessarily identical.
method_label: This intuition is encoded as a distance-dependent CRP with a distance between two syntactic signatures indicating how likely they are to correspond to a single semantic role.
method_label: These distances are automatically induced within the model and shared across predicates.
result_label: Both models achieve state-of-the-art results when evaluated on PropBank, with the coupled model consistently outperforming the factored counterpart in all experimental set-ups.

TITLE: Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling: Approaching from an Unsupervised Perspective
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTReducing the reliance of semantic role labeling (SRL) methods on human-annotated data has become an active area of research.
background_label: However, the prior work has largely focused on either (1) looking into ways to improve supervised SRL systems by producing surrogate annotated data and reducing sparsity of lexical features or (2) considering completely unsupervised semantic role induction settings.
objective_label: In this work, we aim to link these two veins of research by studying how unsupervised techniques can be improved by exploiting small amounts of labeled data.
method_label: We extend a state-of-the-art Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic role induction to better accommodate for annotated sentences.
result_label: Our semi-supervised method outperforms a strong supervised baseline when only a small amount of labeled data is available.

TITLE: Unsupervised Induction of Semantic Roles
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractDatasets annotated with semantic roles are an important prerequisite to developing highperformance role labeling systems.
background_label: Unfortunately, the reliance on manual annotations, which are both difficult and highly expensive to produce, presents a major obstacle to the widespread application of these systems across different languages and text genres.
method_label: In this paper we describe a method for inducing the semantic roles of verbal arguments directly from unannotated text.
method_label: We formulate the role induction problem as one of detecting alternations and finding a canonical syntactic form for them.
method_label: Both steps are implemented in a novel probabilistic model, a latent-variable variant of the logistic classifier.
method_label: Our method increases the purity of the induced role clusters by a wide margin over a strong baseline.

TITLE: The Importance of Syntactic Parsing and Inference in Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a general framework for semantic role labeling.
method_label: The framework combines a machine-learning technique with an integer linear programming-based inference procedure, which incorporates linguistic and structural constraints into a global decision process.
objective_label: Within this framework, we study the role of syntactic parsing information in semantic role labeling.
method_label: We show that full syntactic parsing information is, by far, most relevant in identifying the argument, especially, in the very first stagethe pruning stage.
method_label: Surprisingly, the quality of the pruning stage cannot be solely determined based on its recall and precision.
method_label: Instead, it depends on the characteristics of the output candidates that determine the difficulty of the downstream problems.
method_label: Motivated by this observation, we propose an effective and simple approach of combining different semantic role labeling systems through joint inference, which significantly improves its performance.
result_label: Our system has been evaluated in the CoNLL-2005 shared task on semantic role labeling, and achieves the highest F1 score among 19 participants.

TITLE: Cross-Language Frame Semantics Transfer in Bilingual Corpora
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: Recent work on the transfer of semantic information across languages has been recently applied to the development of resources annotated with Frame information for different non-English European languages.
background_label: These works are based on the assumption that parallel corpora annotated for English can be used to transfer the semantic information to the other target languages.
method_label: In this paper, a robust method based on a statistical machine translation step augmented with simple rule-based post-processing is presented.
method_label: It alleviates problems related to preprocessing errors and the complex optimization required by syntax-dependent models of the cross-lingual mapping.
method_label: Different alignment strategies are here investigated against the Europarl corpus.
result_label: Results suggest that the quality of the derived annotations is surprisingly good and well suited for training semantic role labeling systems.

TITLE: Multi-Predicate Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: The current approaches to Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) usually perform role classification for each predicate separately and the interaction among individual predicate’s role labeling is ignored if there is more than one predicate in a sentence.
background_label: In this paper, we prove that different predicates in a sentence could help each other during SRL.
background_label: In multi-predicate role labeling, there are mainly two key points: argument identification and role labeling of the arguments shared by multiple predicates.
method_label: To address these issues, in the stage of argument identification, we propose novel predicate-related features which help remove many argument identification errors; in the stage of argument classification, we adopt a discriminative reranking approach to perform role classification of the shared arguments, in which a large set of global features are proposed.
method_label: We conducted experiments on two standard benchmarks: Chinese PropBank and English PropBank.
result_label: The experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve SRL performance, especially in Chinese PropBank.

TITLE: Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity.
method_label: Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them.
method_label: The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types.
method_label: Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions.
result_label: We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.

TITLE: Semi-supervised Semantic Role Labeling Using the Latent Words Language Model
ABSTRACT: background_label: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has proved to be a valuable tool for performing automatic analysis of natural language texts.
background_label: Currently however, most systems rely on a large training set, which is manually annotated, an effort that needs to be repeated whenever different languages or a different set of semantic roles is used in a certain application.
objective_label: A possible solution for this problem is semi-supervised learning, where a small set of training examples is automatically expanded using unlabeled texts.
method_label: We present the Latent Words Language Model, which is a language model that learns word similarities from unlabeled texts.
method_label: We use these similarities for different semi-supervised SRL methods as additional features or to automatically expand a small training set.
result_label: We evaluate the methods on the PropBank dataset and find that for small training sizes our best performing system achieves an error reduction of 33.27% F1-measure compared to a state-of-the-art supervised baseline.

TITLE: Effective weakly supervised semantic frame induction using expression sharing in hierarchical hidden Markov models
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a framework for the induction of semantic frames from utterances in the context of an adaptive command-and-control interface.
background_label: The system is trained on an individual user's utterances and the corresponding semantic frames representing controls.
background_label: During training, no prior information on the alignment between utterance segments and frame slots and values is available.
background_label: In addition, semantic frames in the training data can contain information that is not expressed in the utterances.
method_label: To tackle this weakly supervised classification task, we propose a framework based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).
method_label: Structural modifications, resulting in a hierarchical HMM, and an extension called expression sharing are introduced to minimize the amount of training time and effort required for the user.
method_label: The dataset used for the present study is PATCOR, which contains commands uttered in the context of a vocally guided card game, Patience.
method_label: Experiments were carried out on orthographic and phonetic transcriptions of commands, segmented on different levels of n-gram granularity.
result_label: The experimental results show positive effects of all the studied system extensions, with some effect differences between the different input representations.
result_label: Moreover, evaluation experiments on held-out data with the optimal system configuration show that the extended system is able to achieve high accuracies with relatively small amounts of training data.

TITLE: Discrete-State Variational Autoencoders for Joint Discovery and Factorization of Relations
ABSTRACT: method_label: We present a method for unsupervised open-domain relation discovery.
background_label: In contrast to previous (mostly generative and agglomerative clustering) approaches, our model relies on rich contextual features and makes minimal independence assumptions.
method_label: The model is composed of two parts: a feature-rich relation extractor, which predicts a semantic relation between two entities, and a factorization model, which reconstructs arguments (i.e., the entities) relying on the predicted relation.
method_label: The two components are estimated jointly so as to minimize errors in recovering arguments.
method_label: We study factorization models inspired by previous work in relation factorization and selectional preference modeling.
result_label: Our models substantially outperform the generative and agglomerative-clustering counterparts and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TITLE: A Full End-to-End Semantic Role Labeler, Syntactic-agnostic Over Syntactic-aware?
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSemantic role labeling (SRL) is to recognize the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, including subtasks of predicate disambiguation and argument labeling.
background_label: Previous studies usually formulate the entire SRL problem into two or more subtasks.
objective_label: For the first time, this paper introduces an end-to-end neural model which unifiedly tackles the predicate disambiguation and the argument labeling in one shot.
method_label: Using a biaffine scorer, our model directly predicts all semantic role labels for all given word pairs in the sentence without relying on any syntactic parse information.
method_label: Specifically, we augment the BiLSTM encoder with a non-linear transformation to further distinguish the predicate and the argument in a given sentence, and model the semantic role labeling process as a word pair classification task by employing the biaffine attentional mechanism.
result_label: Though the proposed model is syntax-agnostic with local decoder, it outperforms the state-of-the-art syntax-aware SRL systems on the CoNLL-2008, 2009 benchmarks for both English and Chinese.
result_label: To our best knowledge, we report the first syntax-agnostic SRL model that surpasses all known syntax-aware models.

ABSTRACT: background_label: Human infants learn meanings for spoken words in complex interactions with other people, but the exact learning mechanisms are unknown.
background_label: Among researchers, a widely studied learning mechanism is called cross-situational learning (XSL).
background_label: In XSL, word meanings are learned when learners accumulate statistical information between spoken words and co-occurring objects or events, allowing the learner to overcome referential uncertainty after having sufficient experience with individually ambiguous scenarios.
background_label: Existing models in this area have mainly assumed that the learner is capable of segmenting words from speech before grounding them to their referential meaning, while segmentation itself has been treated relatively independently of the meaning acquisition.
method_label: In this article, we argue that XSL is not just a mechanism for word-to-meaning mapping, but that it provides strong cues for proto-lexical word segmentation.
result_label: If a learner directly solves the correspondence problem between continuous speech input and the contextual referents being talked about, segmentation of the input into word-like units emerges as a by-product of the learning.
background_label: We present a theoretical model for joint acquisition of proto-lexical segments and their meanings without assuming a priori knowledge of the language.
method_label: We also investigate the behavior of the model using a computational implementation, making use of transition probability-based statistical learning.
result_label: Results from simulations show that the model is not only capable of replicating behavioral data on word learning in artificial languages, but also shows effective learning of word segments and their meanings from continuous speech.
result_label: Moreover, when augmented with a simple familiarity preference during learning, the model shows a good fit to human behavioral data in XSL tasks.
result_label: These results support the idea of simultaneous segmentation and meaning acquisition and show that comprehensive models of early word segmentation should take referential word meanings into account.

TITLE: Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling via Structural Alignment
ABSTRACT: background_label: Large-scale annotated corpora are a prerequisite to developing high-performance semantic role labeling systems.
background_label: Unfortunately, such corpora are expensive to produce, limited in size, and may not be representative.
objective_label: Our work aims to reduce the annotation effort involved in creating resources for semantic role labeling via semi-supervised learning.
objective_label: The key idea of our approach is to find novel instances for classifier training based on their similarity to manually labeled seed instances.
method_label: The underlying assumption is that sentences that are similar in their lexical material and syntactic structure are likely to share a frame semantic analysis.
method_label: We formalize the detection of similar sentences and the projection of role annotations as a graph alignment problem, which we solve exactly using integer linear programming.
result_label: Experimental results on semantic role labeling show that the automatic annotations produced by our method improve performance over using hand-labeled instances alone.

TITLE: Cross-Lingual Transfer of Semantic Roles: From Raw Text to Semantic Roles
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe a transfer method based on annotation projection to develop a dependency-based semantic role labeling system for languages for which no supervised linguistic information other than parallel data is available.
background_label: Unlike previous work that presumes the availability of supervised features such as lemmas, part-of-speech tags, and dependency parse trees, we only make use of word and character features.
method_label: Our deep model considers using character-based representations as well as unsupervised stem embeddings to alleviate the need for supervised features.
result_label: Our experiments outperform a state-of-the-art method that uses supervised lexico-syntactic features on 6 out of 7 languages in the Universal Proposition Bank.

TITLE: Inducing Example-based Semantic Frames from a Massive Amount of Verb Uses
ABSTRACT: method_label: We present an unsupervised method for inducing semantic frames from verb uses in giga-word corpora.

method_label: We use the Chinese Restaurant Process to automatically induce these frames from a massive amount of verb instances.
method_label: In our experiments, we acquire broad-coverage semantic frames from two giga-word corpora, the larger comprising 20 billion words.

TITLE: Graph Alignment for Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Unknown lexical items present a major obstacle to the development of broad-coverage semantic role labeling systems.
objective_label: We address this problem with a semi-supervised learning approach which acquires training instances for unseen verbs from an unlabeled corpus.
method_label: Our method relies on the hypothesis that unknown lexical items will be structurally and semantically similar to known items for which annotations are available.
method_label: Accordingly, we represent known and unknown sentences as graphs, formalize the search for the most similar verb as a graph alignment problem and solve the optimization using integer linear programming.
result_label: Experimental results show that role labeling performance for unknown lexical items improves with training data produced automatically by our method.

TITLE: Neural Semantic Role Labeling with Dependency Path Embeddings
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper introduces a novel model for semantic role labeling that makes use of neural sequence modeling techniques.
objective_label: Our approach is motivated by the observation that complex syntactic structures and related phenomena, such as nested subordinations and nominal predicates, are not handled well by existing models.
method_label: Our model treats such instances as sub-sequences of lexicalized dependency paths and learns suitable embedding representations.
result_label: We experimentally demonstrate that such embeddings can improve results over previous state-of-the-art semantic role labelers, and showcase qualitative improvements obtained by our method.

TITLE: Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Graph Partitioning
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper we present a method for unsupervised semantic role induction which we formalize as a graph partitioning problem.
method_label: Argument instances of a verb are represented as vertices in a graph whose edge weights quantify their role-semantic similarity.
method_label: Graph partitioning is realized with an algorithm that iteratively assigns vertices to clusters based on the cluster assignments of neighboring vertices.
method_label: Our method is algorithmically and conceptually simple, especially with respect to how problem-specific knowledge is incorporated into the model.
result_label: Experimental results on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is competitive with other unsupervised approaches in terms of F1 whilst attaining significantly higher cluster purity.

TITLE: A Data-Driven Approach for Semantic Role Labeling from Induced Grammar Structures in Language
ABSTRACT: background_label: Semantic roles play an important role in extracting knowledge from text.
background_label: Current unsupervised approaches utilize features from grammar structures, to induce semantic roles.
background_label: The dependence on these grammars, however, makes it difficult to adapt to noisy and new languages.
objective_label: In this paper we develop a data-driven approach to identifying semantic roles, the approach is entirely unsupervised up to the point where rules need to be learned to identify the position the semantic role occurs.
method_label: Specifically we develop a modified-ADIOS algorithm based on ADIOS Solan et al.
method_label: (2005) to learn grammar structures, and use these grammar structures to learn the rules for identifying the semantic roles based on the context in which the grammar structures appeared.
result_label: The results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-art models that are inherently dependent on human annotated data.

TITLE: A Full End-to-End Semantic Role Labeler, Syntax-agnostic Over Syntax-aware?
ABSTRACT: background_label: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is to recognize the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, including subtasks of predicate disambiguation and argument labeling.
background_label: Previous studies usually formulate the entire SRL problem into two or more subtasks.
objective_label: For the first time, this paper introduces an end-to-end neural model which unifiedly tackles the predicate disambiguation and the argument labeling in one shot.
method_label: Using a biaffine scorer, our model directly predicts all semantic role labels for all given word pairs in the sentence without relying on any syntactic parse information.
method_label: Specifically, we augment the BiLSTM encoder with a non-linear transformation to further distinguish the predicate and the argument in a given sentence, and model the semantic role labeling process as a word pair classification task by employing the biaffine attentional mechanism.
result_label: Though the proposed model is syntax-agnostic with local decoder, it outperforms the state-of-the-art syntax-aware SRL systems on the CoNLL-2008, 2009 benchmarks for both English and Chinese.
result_label: To our best knowledge, we report the first syntax-agnostic SRL model that surpasses all known syntax-aware models.

TITLE: BIOSMILE: A semantic role labeling system for biomedical verbs using a maximum-entropy model with automatically generated template features
ABSTRACT: background_label: BackgroundBioinformatics tools for automatic processing of biomedical literature are invaluable for both the design and interpretation of large-scale experiments.
background_label: Many information extraction (IE) systems that incorporate natural language processing (NLP) techniques have thus been developed for use in the biomedical field.
background_label: A key IE task in this field is the extraction of biomedical relations, such as protein-protein and gene-disease interactions.
background_label: However, most biomedical relation extraction systems usually ignore adverbial and prepositional phrases and words identifying location, manner, timing, and condition, which are essential for describing biomedical relations.
method_label: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a natural language processing technique that identifies the semantic roles of these words or phrases in sentences and expresses them as predicate-argument structures.
method_label: We construct a biomedical SRL system called BIOSMILE that uses a maximum entropy (ME) machine-learning model to extract biomedical relations.
result_label: BIOSMILE is trained on BioProp, our semi-automatic, annotated biomedical proposition bank.
method_label: Currently, we are focusing on 30 biomedical verbs that are frequently used or considered important for describing molecular events.ResultsTo evaluate the performance of BIOSMILE, we conducted two experiments to (1) compare the performance of SRL systems trained on newswire and biomedical corpora; and (2) examine the effects of using biomedical-specific features.
result_label: The experimental results show that using BioProp improves the F-score of the SRL system by 21.45% over an SRL system that uses a newswire corpus.
method_label: It is noteworthy that adding automatically generated template features improves the overall F-score by a further 0.52%.
result_label: Specifically, ArgM-LOC, ArgM-MNR, and Arg2 achieve statistically significant performance improvements of 3.33%, 2.27%, and 1.44%, respectively.ConclusionWe demonstrate the necessity of using a biomedical proposition bank for training SRL systems in the biomedical domain.
result_label: Besides the different characteristics of biomedical and newswire sentences, factors such as cross-domain framesets and verb usage variations also influence the performance of SRL systems.
method_label: For argument classification, we find that NE (named entity) features indicating if the target node matches with NEs are not effective, since NEs may match with a node of the parsing tree that does not have semantic role labels in the training set.
method_label: We therefore incorporate templates composed of specific words, NE types, and POS tags into the SRL system.
result_label: As a result, the classification accuracy for adjunct arguments, which is especially important for biomedical SRL, is improved significantly.

TITLE: Multiplicative Representations for Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn unsupervised semantic role labeling, identifying the role of an argument is usually informed by its dependency relation with the predicate.
objective_label: In this work, we propose a neural model to learn argument embeddings from the context by explicitly incorporating dependency relations as multiplicative factors, which bias argument embeddings according to their dependency roles.
method_label: Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art embeddings in unsupervised semantic role induction on the CoNLL 2008 dataset and the SimLex999 word similarity task.
result_label: Qualitative results demonstrate our model can effectively bias argument embeddings based on their dependency role.

TITLE: Semantic Role Labeling with Neural Network Factors
ABSTRACT: method_label: We present a new method for semantic role labeling in which arguments and semantic roles are jointly embedded in a shared vector space for a given predicate.

method_label: We consider both local and structured learning methods and obtain strong results on standard PropBank and FrameNet corpora with a straightforward product-of-experts model.
result_label: We further show how the model can learn jointly from PropBank and FrameNet annotations to obtain additional improvements on the smaller FrameNet dataset.

TITLE: A Hierarchical Unification of LIRICS and VerbNet Semantic Roles
ABSTRACT: background_label: This research compares several of the thematic roles of Verb Net (VN) to those of the Linguistic Infrastructure for Interoperable Resources and Systems (LIRICS).
objective_label: The purpose of this comparison is to develop a standard set of thematic roles that would be suited to a variety of natural language processing (NLP) applications.
method_label: We draw from both resources to construct a unified set of semantic roles that will replace existing VN semantic roles.
method_label: Through the process of comparison, we find that a hierarchical organization of coarse-grained, intermediate and fine-grained roles facilitates mapping between semantic resources of differing granularity and allows for flexibility in how VN can be used for diverse NLP applications, thus, we propose a hierarchical taxonomy of the unified role set.
result_label: The comparison and subsequent development of the hierarchy reveals a level of granularity shared by both resources, which could be further developed into a standard set of thematic roles for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

TITLE: Designing an algorithm for role analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: This thesis presents a system for specifying constraints on dynamically changing referencing relationships of heap objects, and an analysis for static verification of these constraints.
background_label: The constraint specification system is based on the concept of role.
background_label: The role of an object depends, in large part, on its aliasing relationships with other objects, with the role of each object changing as its aliasing relationships change.
method_label: In this way roles capture object and data structure properties such as unique references, membership of objects in data structures, disjointness of data structures, absence of representation exposure, bidirectional associations, treeness, and absence or presence of cycles in the heap.
method_label: Roles generalize linear types by allowing multiple aliases of heap objects that participate in recursive data structures.
result_label: Unlike graph grammars and graph types, roles contain sufficiently general constraints to conservatively approximate any data structure.
background_label: We give a semantics for mutually recursive role definitions and derive properties of roles as an invariant specification language.
background_label: We introduce a programming model that allows temporary violations of role constraints.
method_label: We describe a static role analysis for verifying that a program conforms to the programming model.
method_label: The analysis uses fixpoint computation to synthesize loop invariants in each procedure.
method_label: We introduce a procedure interface specification language and its semantics.
method_label: We present an interprocedural, compositional, and context-sensitive role analysis that verifies that a program respects the role constraints across procedure calls.

TITLE: The Proposition Bank: An Annotated Corpus Of Semantic Roles
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Proposition Bank project takes a practical approach to semantic representation, adding a layer of predicate-argument information, or semantic role labels, to the syntactic structures of the Penn Treebank.
background_label: The resulting resource can be thought of as shallow, in that it does not represent coreference, quantification, and many other higher-order phenomena, but also broad, in that it covers every instance of every verb in the corpus and allows representative statistics to be calculated.
method_label: We discuss the criteria used to define the sets of semantic roles used in the annotation process and to analyze the frequency of syntactic/semantic alternations in the corpus.
method_label: We describe an automatic system for semantic role tagging trained on the corpus and discuss the effect on its performance of various types of information, including a comparison of full syntactic parsing with a flat representation and the contribution of the empty trace categories of the treebank.

TITLE: Connectionist Learning Procedures
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACT
objective_label: A major goal of research on networks of neuron-like processing units is to discover efficient learning procedures that allow these networks to construct complex internal representations of their environment.
background_label: The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain.
method_label: Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered.
method_label: Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network.
method_label: The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error.
result_label: These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work well for small tasks and the new challenge is to find ways of improving their convergence rate and theirgeneralization abilities so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks.

TITLE: A Joint Sequential and Relational Model for Frame-Semantic Parsing
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe introduce a new method for framesemantic parsing that significantly improves the prior state of the art.
method_label: Our model leverages the advantages of a deep bidirectional LSTM network which predicts semantic role labels word by word and a relational network which predicts semantic roles for individual text expressions in relation to a predicate.
method_label: The two networks are integrated into a single model via knowledge distillation, and a unified graphical model is employed to jointly decode frames and semantic roles during inference.
result_label: Experiments on the standard FrameNet data show that our model significantly outperforms existing neural and non-neural approaches, achieving a 5.7 F1 gain over the current state of the art, for full frame structure extraction.

TITLE: Role Engineering via Prioritized Subset Enumeration
ABSTRACT: background_label: Today, role-based access control (RBAC) has become a well-accepted paradigm for implementing access control because of its convenience and ease of administration.
background_label: However, in order to realize the full benefits of the RBAC paradigm, one must first define the roles accurately.
background_label: This task of defining roles and associating permissions with them, also known as role engineering, is typically accomplished either in a top-down or in a bottom-up manner.
method_label: Under the top-down approach, a careful analysis of the business processes is done to first define job functions and then to specify appropriate roles from them.
method_label: While this approach can help in defining roles more accurately, it is tedious and time consuming since it requires that the semantics of the business processes be well understood.
method_label: Moreover, it ignores existing permissions within an organization and does not utilize them.
result_label: On the other hand, under the bottom-up approach, existing permissions are used to derive roles from them.
background_label: As a result, it may help automate the process of role definition.
background_label: In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach, called RoleMiner, for mining roles from existing user-permission assignments.
background_label: Since a role, when semantics are unavailable, is nothing but a set of permissions, the task of role mining is essentially that of clustering users having the same (or similar) permissions.
background_label: However, unlike the traditional applications of data mining that ideally require identification of nonoverlapping clusters, roles will have overlapping permissions and thus permission sets that define roles should be allowed to overlap.
method_label: It is this distinction from traditional clustering that makes the problem of role mining nontrivial.
result_label: Our experiments with real and simulated data sets indicate that our role mining process is quite accurate and efficient.
result_label: Since our role mining approach is based on subset enumeration, it is fairly robust to reasonable levels of noise.

TITLE: Memory-Based Acquisition of Argument Structures and its Application to Implicit Role Detection
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose a generic, memory-based approach for the detection of implicit semantic roles.
method_label: While state-of-the-art methods for this task combine hand-crafted rules with specialized and costly lexical resources, our models use large corpora with automated annotations for explicit semantic roles only to capture the distribution of predicates and their associated roles.
result_label: We show that memory-based learning can increase the recognition rate of implicit roles beyond the state-of-the-art.

TITLE: Relation Extraction with Matrix Factorization and Universal Schemas
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractTraditional relation extraction predicts relations within some fixed and finite target schema.
background_label: Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema.
background_label: The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of preexisting databases).
background_label: This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases).
method_label: To populate a database of such schema we present matrix factorization models that learn latent feature vectors for entity tuples and relations.
method_label: We show that such latent models achieve substantially higher accuracy than a traditional classification approach.
result_label: More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways.
result_label: By doing so our approach outperforms stateof-the-art distant supervision.

TITLE: Relation Alignment for Textual Entailment Recognition
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present an approach to textual entailment recognition, in which inference is based on a shallow semantic representation of relations (predicates and their arguments) in the text and hypothesis of the entailment pair, and in which specialized knowledge is encapsulated in modular components with very simple interfaces.
method_label: We propose an architecture designed to integrate different, unscaled Natural Language Processing resources, and demonstrate an alignment-based method for combining them.
method_label: We clarify the purpose of alignment in the RTE task, identifying two distinct alignment models, each of which leads to a different type of entailment system.
method_label: We identify desirable properties of alignment, and use this to inform our implementation of an alignment component.
result_label: We evaluate the resulting system on the RTE5 data set, and use an ablation study to assess the conformance of our alignment approach with these desired characteristics.

TITLE: Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Global Role Ordering
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractWe propose a probabilistic generative model for unsupervised semantic role induction, which integrates local role assignment decisions and a global role ordering decision in a unified model.
method_label: The role sequence is divided into intervals based on the notion of primary roles, and each interval generates a sequence of secondary roles and syntactic constituents using local features.
method_label: The global role ordering consists of the sequence of primary roles only, thus making it a partial ordering.

TITLE: Dependency-based Syntactic-Semantic Analysis with PropBank and NomBank
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper presents our contribution in the closed track of the 2008 CoNLL Shared Task (Surdeanu et al., 2008).
objective_label: To tackle the problem of joint syntactic--semantic analysis, the system relies on a syntactic and a semantic subcomponent.
method_label: The syntactic model is a bottom-up projective parser using pseudo-projective transformations, and the semantic model uses global inference mechanisms on top of a pipeline of classifiers.
method_label: The complete syntactic--semantic output is selected from a candidate pool generated by the subsystems.
result_label: The system achieved the top score in the closed challenge: a labeled syntactic accuracy of 89.32%, a labeled semantic F1 of 81.65, and a labeled macro F1 of 85.49.

TITLE: Semi-Supervised and Latent-Variable Models of Natural Language Semantics
ABSTRACT: background_label: This thesis focuses on robust analysis of natural language semantics.
background_label: A primary bottleneck for semantic processing of text lies in the scarcity of high-quality and large amounts of annotated data that provide complete information about the semantic structure of natural language expressions.
objective_label: In this dissertation, we study statistical models tailored to solve problems in computational semantics, with a focus on modeling structure that is not visible in annotated text data.
method_label: We first investigate supervised methods for modeling two kinds of semantic phenomena in language.
method_label: First, we focus on the problem of paraphrase identification, which attempts to recognize whether two sentences convey the same meaning.
method_label: Second, we concentrate on shallow semantic parsing, adopting the theory of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982).
method_label: Frame semantics offers deep linguistic analysis that exploits the use of lexical semantic properties and relationships among semantic frames and roles.
result_label: Unfortunately, the datasets used to train our paraphrase and frame-semantic parsing models are too small to lead to robust performance.
background_label: Therefore, a common trait in our methods is the hypothesis of hidden structure in the data.
method_label: To this end, we employ conditional loglinear models over structures, that are firstly capable of incorporating a wide variety of features gathered from the data as well as various lexica, and secondly use latent variables to model missing information in annotated data.
method_label: Our approaches towards solving these two problems achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on standard corpora.
method_label: For the frame-semantic parsing problem, we present fast inference techniques for jointly modeling the semantic roles of a given predicate.
method_label: We experiment with linear program formulations, and use a commercial solver as well as an exact dual decomposition technique that breaks the role labeling problem into several overlapping components.
method_label: Continuing with the theme of hypothesizing hidden structure in data for modeling natural language semantics, we present methods to leverage large volumes of unlabeled data to improve upon the shallow semantic parsing task.
method_label: We work within the framework of graph-based semi-supervised learning, a powerful method that associates similar natural language types, and helps propagate supervised annotations to unlabeled data.
method_label: We use this framework to improve frame-semantic parsing performance on unknown predicates that are absent in annotated data.
result_label: We also present a family of novel

TITLE: Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets.
method_label: The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks.
background_label: We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e.
method_label: it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set.
result_label: Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.

TITLE: Situation Recognition with Graph Neural Networks
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We address the problem of recognizing situations in images.
objective_label: Given an image, the task is to predict the most salient verb (action), and fill its semantic roles such as who is performing the action, what is the source and target of the action, etc.
background_label: Different verbs have different roles (e.g.
background_label: attacking has weapon), and each role can take on many possible values (nouns).
method_label: We propose a model based on Graph Neural Networks that allows us to efficiently capture joint dependencies between roles using neural networks defined on a graph.
method_label: Experiments with different graph connectivities show that our approach that propagates information between roles significantly outperforms existing work, as well as multiple baselines.
result_label: We obtain roughly 3-5% improvement over previous work in predicting the full situation.
result_label: We also provide a thorough qualitative analysis of our model and influence of different roles in the verbs.

TITLE: Conditional Random Field Autoencoders for Unsupervised Structured Prediction
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce a framework for unsupervised learning of structured predictors with overlapping, global features.
method_label: Each input's latent representation is predicted conditional on the observable data using a feature-rich conditional random field.
method_label: Then a reconstruction of the input is (re)generated, conditional on the latent structure, using models for which maximum likelihood estimation has a closed-form.
method_label: Our autoencoder formulation enables efficient learning without making unrealistic independence assumptions or restricting the kinds of features that can be used.
method_label: We illustrate insightful connections to traditional autoencoders, posterior regularization and multi-view learning.
result_label: We show competitive results with instantiations of the model for two canonical NLP tasks: part-of-speech induction and bitext word alignment, and show that training our model can be substantially more efficient than comparable feature-rich baselines.

TITLE: Emergent roles in decision-making tasks using group chat
ABSTRACT: background_label: Individuals assume roles in all aspects of life, including in computer-supported collaborative settings.
background_label: The concept of roles is particularly interesting in settings where no formal roles are defined, as in self-managing virtual teams.
background_label: In these settings, roles often emerge not only as a result of individual characteristics, but also as participants interact with each other and develop norms of behavior.
method_label: Using role theory and speech act theory, this study explores the emergence of roles in computer-mediated decision-making groups, using chat transcripts from a lab experiment.
result_label: Results indicate that four distinct roles emerge as individuals come together in decision-making groups using synchronous computer-mediated communication.
result_label: These emerging roles have implications for virtual teams in research and practice.

TITLE: Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque.
method_label: We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors.
method_label: The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods.
method_label: Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus.
method_label: The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task.
result_label: It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.

TITLE: Semi-Supervised Frame-Semantic Parsing for Unknown Predicates
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe describe a new approach to disambiguating semantic frames evoked by lexical predicates previously unseen in a lexicon or annotated data.
method_label: Our approach makes use of large amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework.
method_label: We construct a large graph where vertices correspond to potential predicates and use label propagation to learn possible semantic frames for new ones.
result_label: The label-propagated graph is used within a frame-semantic parser and, for unknown predicates, results in over 15% absolute improvement in frame identification accuracy and over 13% absolute improvement in full frame-semantic parsing F 1 score on a blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised baseline.

TITLE: Unsupervised Ontology Induction from Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractExtracting knowledge from unstructured text is a long-standing goal of NLP.
background_label: Although learning approaches to many of its subtasks have been developed (e.g., parsing, taxonomy induction, information extraction), all end-to-end solutions to date require heavy supervision and/or manual engineering, limiting their scope and scalability.
method_label: We present OntoUSP, a system that induces and populates a probabilistic ontology using only dependency-parsed text as input.
method_label: OntoUSP builds on the USP unsupervised semantic parser by jointly forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of lambda-form clusters.
method_label: The ISA hierarchy allows more general knowledge to be learned, and the use of smoothing for parameter estimation.
result_label: We evaluate OntoUSP by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions.
result_label: OntoUSP improves on the recall of USP by 47% and greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.

TITLE: Improving Neural Language Models by Segmenting, Attending, and Predicting the Future
ABSTRACT: background_label: Common language models typically predict the next word given the context.
method_label: In this work, we propose a method that improves language modeling by learning to align the given context and the following phrase.
method_label: The model does not require any linguistic annotation of phrase segmentation.
method_label: Instead, we define syntactic heights and phrase segmentation rules, enabling the model to automatically induce phrases, recognize their task-specific heads, and generate phrase embeddings in an unsupervised learning manner.
method_label: Our method can easily be applied to language models with different network architectures since an independent module is used for phrase induction and context-phrase alignment, and no change is required in the underlying language modeling network.
method_label: Experiments have shown that our model outperformed several strong baseline models on different data sets.
result_label: We achieved a new state-of-the-art performance of 17.4 perplexity on the Wikitext-103 dataset.
result_label: Additionally, visualizing the outputs of the phrase induction module showed that our model is able to learn approximate phrase-level structural knowledge without any annotation.

TITLE: Measuring Thematic Fit with Distributional Feature Overlap
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we introduce a new distributional method for modeling predicate-argument thematic fit judgments.
background_label: We use a syntax-based DSM to build a prototypical representation of verb-specific roles: for every verb, we extract the most salient second order contexts for each of its roles (i.e.
method_label: the most salient dimensions of typical role fillers), and then we compute thematic fit as a weighted overlap between the top features of candidate fillers and role prototypes.
result_label: Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms a baseline re-implementing a state-of-the-art system, and achieves better or comparable results to those reported in the literature for the other unsupervised systems.
result_label: Moreover, it provides an explicit representation of the features characterizing verb-specific semantic roles.

TITLE: The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task on Joint Parsing of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is accompanied every year by a shared task whose purpose is to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting.
background_label: In 2008 the shared task was dedicated to the joint parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies.
method_label: This shared task not only unifies the shared tasks of the previous four years under a unique dependency-based formalism, but also extends them significantly: this year's syntactic dependencies include more information such as named-entity boundaries; the semantic dependencies model roles of both verbal and nominal predicates.
method_label: In this paper, we define the shared task and describe how the data sets were created.
result_label: Furthermore, we report and analyze the results and describe the approaches of the participating systems.

TITLE: Video Event Detection Using Temporal Pyramids of Visual Semantics with Kernel Optimization and Model Subspace Boosting
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this study, we present a system for video event classification that generates a temporal pyramid of static visual semantics using minimum-value, maximum-value, and average-value aggregation techniques.
method_label: Kernel optimization and model subspace boosting are then applied to customize the pyramid for each event.
method_label: SVM models are independently trained for each level in the pyramid using kernel selection according to 3-fold cross-validation.
method_label: Kernels that both enforce static temporal order and permit temporal alignment are evaluated.
method_label: Model subspace boosting is used to select the best combination of pyramid levels and aggregation techniques for each event.
method_label: The NIST TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) 2011 dataset was used for evaluation.
result_label: Results demonstrate that kernel optimizations using both temporally static and dynamic kernels together achieves better performance than any one particular method alone.
result_label: In addition, model sub-space boosting reduces the size of the model by 80%, while maintaining 96% of the performance gain.

TITLE: Feature selection for unsupervised and supervised inference: the emergence of sparsity in a weighted-based approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science including - examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bioinformatics are abundant.
objective_label: We present a definition of "relevancy" based on spectral properties of the Affinity (or Laplacian) of the features' measurement matrix.
method_label: The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features defined by a least-squares optimization process.
method_label: A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a "biased nonnegativity" of a key matrix in the process.
result_label: As a result, a simple least-squares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maxima over the relevance function.
result_label: The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence shows that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.

TITLE: Extracting and composing robust features with denoising autoencoders
ABSTRACT: background_label: Previous work has shown that the difficulties in learning deep generative or discriminative models can be overcome by an initial unsupervised learning step that maps inputs to useful intermediate representations.
objective_label: We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern.
method_label: This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures.
method_label: The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective.
result_label: Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.

TITLE: On the Supermodularity of Active Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning with Stieltjes Matrix Regularization
ABSTRACT: background_label: Active graph-based semi-supervised learning (AG-SSL) aims to select a small set of labeled examples and utilize their graph-based relation to other unlabeled examples to aid in machine learning tasks.
background_label: It is also closely related to the sampling theory in graph signal processing.
method_label: In this paper, we revisit the original formulation of graph-based SSL and prove the supermodularity of an AG-SSL objective function under a broad class of regularization functions parameterized by Stieltjes matrices.
method_label: Under this setting, supermodularity yields a novel greedy label sampling algorithm with guaranteed performance relative to the optimal sampling set.
result_label: Compared to three state-of-the-art graph signal sampling and recovery methods on two real-life community detection datasets, the proposed AG-SSL method attains superior classification accuracy given limited sample budgets.

TITLE: A Bayesian Model of Multilingual Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction
ABSTRACT: background_label: We propose a Bayesian model of unsupervised semantic role induction in multiple languages, and use it to explore the usefulness of parallel corpora for this task.
method_label: Our joint Bayesian model consists of individual models for each language plus additional latent variables that capture alignments between roles across languages.
method_label: Because it is a generative Bayesian model, we can do evaluations in a variety of scenarios just by varying the inference procedure, without changing the model, thereby comparing the scenarios directly.
method_label: We compare using only monolingual data, using a parallel corpus, using a parallel corpus with annotations in the other language, and using small amounts of annotation in the target language.
result_label: We find that the biggest impact of adding a parallel corpus to training is actually the increase in mono-lingual data, with the alignments to another language resulting in small improvements, even with labeled data for the other language.

TITLE: Noise reduction and targeted exploration in imitation learning for Abstract Meaning Representation parsing
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSemantic parsers map natural language statements into meaning representations, and must abstract over syntactic phenomena, resolve anaphora, and identify word senses to eliminate ambiguous interpretations.
background_label: Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a recent example of one such semantic formalism which, similar to a dependency parse, utilizes a graph to represent relationships between concepts (Banarescu et al., 2013).
background_label: As with dependency parsing, transition-based approaches are a common approach to this problem.
background_label: However, when trained in the traditional manner these systems are susceptible to the accumulation of errors when they find undesirable states during greedy decoding.
method_label: Imitation learning algorithms have been shown to help these systems recover from such errors.
method_label: To effectively use these methods for AMR parsing we find it highly beneficial to introduce two novel extensions: noise reduction and targeted exploration.
method_label: The former mitigates the noise in the feature representation, a result of the complexity of the task.
method_label: The latter targets the exploration steps of imitation learning towards areas which are likely to provide the most information in the context of a large action-space.
result_label: We achieve state-ofthe art results, and improve upon standard transition-based parsing by 4.7 F 1 points.

TITLE: RoleMiner: mining roles using subset enumeration
ABSTRACT: background_label: Role engineering, the task of defining roles and associating permissions to them, is essential to realize the full benefits of the role-based access control paradigm.
background_label: Essentially, there are two basic approaches to accomplish this: the top-down and the bottom-up.
method_label: The top-down approach relies on a careful analysis of the business processes to define job functions and then specify appropriate roles from them.
method_label: While this approach can aid in defining roles more accurately, it is tedious and time consuming since it requires that the semantics of the business processes be well understood.
result_label: Moreover, it ignores existing permissions within an organization and does not utilize them.
background_label: On the other hand, the bottom-up approach starts with existing permissions and attempts to derive roles from them, thus helping to automate role definition.
background_label: In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach called RoleMiner that mines roles from existing user-permission assignments.
background_label: Since a role is nothing but a set of permissions, when no semantics are available, the task of role mining is essentially that of clustering users that have same (or similar) permissions.
background_label: However, unlike the traditional applications of data mining that ideally require identification of non-overlapping clusters, roles will have overlapping permission needs and thus permission sets that define roles should be allowed to overlap.
method_label: It is this distinction from traditional clustering that makes the problem of role mining non-trivial.
result_label: Our experiments with real and simulated data sets indicate that our role mining process is quite accurate and efficient.

TITLE: Exploiting Acoustic and Syntactic Features for Automatic Prosody Labeling in a Maximum Entropy Framework
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we describe a maximum entropy-based automatic prosody labeling framework that exploits both language and speech information.
method_label: We apply the proposed framework to both prominence and phrase structure detection within the Tones and Break Indices (ToBI) annotation scheme.
method_label: Our framework utilizes novel syntactic features in the form of supertags and a quantized acoustic-prosodic feature representation that is similar to linear parameterizations of the prosodic contour.
method_label: The proposed model is trained discriminatively and is robust in the selection of appropriate features for the task of prosody detection.
method_label: The proposed maximum entropy acoustic-syntactic model achieves pitch accent and boundary tone detection accuracies of 86.0% and 93.1% on the Boston University Radio News corpus, and, 79.8% and 90.3% on the Boston Directions corpus.
result_label: The phrase structure detection through prosodic break index labeling provides accuracies of 84% and 87% on the two corpora, respectively.
result_label: The reported results are significantly better than previously reported results and demonstrate the strength of maximum entropy model in jointly modeling simple lexical, syntactic, and acoustic features for automatic prosody labeling.

TITLE: The document representation problem: an analysis of lsi and iterative residual rescaling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Important text analysis problems in information retrieval and natural language processing, such as document clustering and automatic text summarization, require accurate measurement of inter-document similarity.
objective_label: The goal of this work is to find methods for automatically creating document representations in which inter-document similarity measurements correspond to human judgment.
method_label: We present a new model for the task of creating document representations.
method_label: From this model, we derive a new analysis of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which is one of the successful approaches that has been studied extensively.
result_label: In particular, we show a precise relationship between LSI''s performance and the uniformity of the underlying distribution of documents over topics.
background_label: As a consequence, we propose a novel alternative method called Iterative Residual Rescaling (IRR), that, crucially, compensates for distributional non-uniformity.
method_label: Experiments over a variety of practically-encountered settings and with several evaluation metrics validate our theoretical prediction and confirm the effectiveness of IRR in comparison to LSI.
method_label: We also propose several extensions including a new document sampling method to scale IRR up to large document collections.
method_label: Comparison with random sampling provides further empirical evidence that performance can be improved by counteracting non-uniformity.
method_label: Finally, we present a system for multi-document summarization based on IRR, which demonstrates that IRR can be immediately useful in applications.
result_label: We show that IRR works as a framework to find a tightly connected (and therefore interpretable) set of coherent texts, and effectively present them to the user.

TITLE: Mining roles with semantic meanings
ABSTRACT: background_label: With the growing adoption of role-based access control (RBAC) in commercial security and identity management products, how to facilitate the process of migrating a non-RBAC system to an RBAC system has become a problem with significant business impact.
objective_label: Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complement the costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction.
objective_label: A key problem that has not been adequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roles with semantic meanings.
method_label: In this paper, we study the problem in two settings with different information availability.
method_label: When the only information is user-permission relation, we propose to discover roles whose semantic meaning is based on formal concept lattices.
method_label: We argue that the theory of formal concept analysis provides a solid theoretical foundation for mining roles from userpermission relation.
method_label: When user-attribute information is also available, we propose to create roles that can be explained by expressions of user-attributes.
method_label: Since an expression of attributes describes a real-world concept, the corresponding role represents a real-world concept as well.
method_label: Furthermore, the algorithms we proposed balance the semantic guarantee of roles with system complexity.
result_label: Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

TITLE: Semi-supervised Stacked Label Consistent Autoencoder for Reconstruction and Analysis of Biomedical Signals
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Objective: An autoencoder-based framework that simultaneously reconstruct and classify biomedical signals is proposed.
background_label: Previous work has treated reconstruction and classification as separate problems.
objective_label: This is the first study that proposes a combined framework to address the issue in a holistic fashion.
method_label: Methods: For telemonitoring purposes, reconstruction techniques of biomedical signals are largely based on compressed sensing (CS); these are “designed” techniques where the reconstruction formulation is based on some “assumption” regarding the signal.
method_label: In this study, we propose a new paradigm for reconstruction—the reconstruction is “learned,” using an autoencoder; it does not require any assumption regarding the signal as long as there is sufficiently large training data.
result_label: But since the final goal is to analyze/classify the signal, the system can also learn a linear classification map that is added inside the autoencoder.
background_label: The ensuing optimization problem is solved using the Split Bregman technique.
background_label: Results: Experiments were carried out on reconstructing and classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) (arrhythmia classification) and EEG (seizure classification) signals.
objective_label: Conclusion: Our proposed tool is capable of operating in a semi-supervised fashion.
method_label: We show that our proposed method is better in reconstruction and more than an order magnitude faster than CS based methods; it is capable of real-time operation.
method_label: Our method also yields better results than recently proposed classification methods.
result_label: Significance: This is the first study offering an alternative to CS-based reconstruction.
result_label: It also shows that the representation learning approach can yield better results than traditional methods that use hand-crafted features for signal analysis.

TITLE: SegSALSA-STR: A convex formulation to supervised hyperspectral image segmentation using hidden fields and structure tensor regularization
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present a supervised hyperspectral image segmentation algorithm based on a convex formulation of a marginal maximum a posteriori segmentation with hidden fields and structure tensor regularization: Segmentation via the Constraint Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage by Structure Tensor Regularization (SegSALSA-STR).
method_label: This formulation avoids the generally discrete nature of segmentation problems and the inherent NP-hardness of the integer optimization associated.
method_label: We extend the Segmentation via the Constraint Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage (SegSALSA) algorithm by generalizing the vectorial total variation prior using a structure tensor prior constructed from a patch-based Jacobian.
method_label: The resulting algorithm is convex, time-efficient and highly parallelizable.
result_label: This shows the potential of combining hidden fields with convex optimization through the inclusion of different regularizers.
result_label: The SegSALSA-STR algorithm is validated in the segmentation of real hyperspectral images.

TITLE: DeepMind_Commentary
ABSTRACT: background_label: We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based reasoning is essential.
background_label: However, we favor an approach that centers on one additional ingredient: autonomy.
objective_label: In particular, we aim toward agents that can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human hand-engineering.
method_label: We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not available.
result_label: Here we survey several important examples of the progress that has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities, and highlight some outstanding challenges.

TITLE: RolX : Role Extraction and Mining in Large Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract-Given a graph, how can we automatically discover roles for nodes?
background_label: Roles could be, eg., 'bridges', or 'peripherynodes', etc.
background_label: Roles are compact summaries of a node's behavior that generalize across networks.
background_label: They enable numerous novel and useful network mining tasks, such as sense-making, searching for similar nodes, and node classification.
method_label: We propose RolX (Role eXtraction), a scalable (linear in the number of edges), unsupervised learning approach for automatically extracting roles from general network data.
method_label: We demonstrate the effectiveness of RolX on several network mining tasks, from exploratory data analysis to network transfer learning.
method_label: Moreover, we compare network role discovery with network community discovery.
result_label: We highlight fundamental differences between the two (e.g., roles generalize across disconnected networks, communities do not).

TITLE: Towards Verifying Semantic Roles Co-occurrence
ABSTRACT: background_label: Semantic role theory considers roles as a small universal set of unanalyzed entities.
background_label: It means that formally there are no restrictions on role combinations.
background_label: We argue that the semantic roles co-occur in verb representations.
background_label: It means that there are hidden restrictions on role combinations.
method_label: To demonstrate that a practical and evidence-based approach has been built on in-depth analysis of the largest verb database VerbNet.
result_label: The consequences of this approach are considered.

TITLE: The Integration of Syntax and Semantic Plausibility in a Wide-Coverage Model of Human Sentence Processing
ABSTRACT: background_label: Models of human sentence processing have paid much attention to three key characteristics of the sentence processor: Its robust and accurate processing of unseen input (wide coverage), its immediate, incremental interpretation of partial input and its sensitivity to structural frequencies in previous language experience.
objective_label: In this thesis, we propose a model of human sentence processing that accounts for these three characteristics and also models a fourth key characteristic, namely the influence of semantic plausibility on sentence processing.
objective_label: The precondition for such a sentence processing model is a general model of human plausibility intuitions.
method_label: We therefore begin by presenting a probabilistic model of the plausibility of verb-argument relations, which we estimate as the probability of encountering a verb-argument pair in the relation specified by a thematic role in a role-annotated training corpus.
result_label: This model faces a significant sparse data problem, which we alleviate by combining two orthogonal smoothing methods.
background_label: We show that the smoothed model’s predictions are significantly correlated to human plausibility judgements for a range of test sets.
method_label: We also demonstrate that our semantic plausibility model outperforms selectional preference models and a standard role labeller, which solve tasks from computational linguistics that are related to the prediction of human judgements.
method_label: We then integrate this semantic plausibility model with an incremental, widecoverage, probabilistic model of syntactic processing to form the Syntax/Semantics (SynSem) Integration model of sentence processing.
method_label: The SynSem-Integration model combines preferences for candidate syntactic structures from two sources: Syntactic probability estimates from a probabilistic parser and our semantic plausibility model’s estimates of the verb-argument relations in each syntactic analysis.
method_label: The model uses these preferences to determine a globally preferred structure and predicts difficulty in human sentence processing either if syntactic and semantic preferences conflict, or if the interpretation of the preferred analysis changes non-monotonically.
result_label: In a thorough evaluation against the patterns of processing difficulty found for four ambiguity phenomena in eight reading-time studies, we demonstrate that the SynSem-Integration model reliably predicts human reading time behaviour.

TITLE: An Expectation Maximization Approach to the Synergy between Image Segmentation and Object Categorization
ABSTRACT: objective_label: In this work, we deal with the problem of modelling and exploiting the interaction between the processes of image segmentation and object categorization.
objective_label: We propose a novel framework to address this problem that is based on the combination of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and generative models for object categories.
method_label: Using a concise formulation of the interaction between these two processes, segmentation is interpreted as the E step, assigning observations to models, whereas object detection/analysis is modelled as the M-step, fitting models to observations.
result_label: We present in detail the segmentation and detection processes comprising the E and M steps and demonstrate results on the joint detection and segmentation of the object categories of faces and cars.

TITLE: A probabilistic approach to hybrid role mining
ABSTRACT: background_label: Role mining algorithms address an important access control problem: configuring a role-based access control system.
background_label: Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role mining discovers a set of roles together with an assignment of users to roles.
background_label: The results should closely agree with the direct assignment.
background_label: Moreover, the roles should be understandable from the business perspective in that they reflect functional roles within the enterprise.
method_label: This requires hybrid role mining methods that work with both direct assignments and business information from the enterprise.
method_label: In this paper, we provide statistical measures to analyze the relevance of different kinds of business information for defining roles.
method_label: We then present an approach that incorporates relevant business information into a probabilistic model with an associated algorithm for hybrid role mining.
result_label: Experiments on actual enterprise data show that our algorithm yields roles that both explain the given user-permission assignments and are meaningful from the business perspective.

TITLE: Fully automatic segmentation of brain tumor images using support vector machine classification in combination with hierarchical conditional random field regularization.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Delineating brain tumor boundaries from magnetic resonance images is an essential task for the analysis of brain cancer.
method_label: We propose a fully automatic method for brain tissue segmentation, which combines Support Vector Machine classification using multispectral intensities and textures with subsequent hierarchical regularization based on Conditional Random Fields.
method_label: The CRF regularization introduces spatial constraints to the powerful SVM classification, which assumes voxels to be independent from their neighbors.
method_label: The approach first separates healthy and tumor tissue before both regions are subclassified into cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, gray matter and necrotic, active, edema region respectively in a novel hierarchical way.
method_label: The hierarchical approach adds robustness and speed by allowing to apply different levels of regularization at different stages.
method_label: The method is fast and tailored to standard clinical acquisition protocols.
result_label: It was assessed on 10 multispectral patient datasets with results outperforming previous methods in terms of segmentation detail and computation times.

TITLE: A unified architecture for natural language processing: deep neural networks with multitask learning
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe a single convolutional neural network architecture that, given a sentence, outputs a host of language processing predictions: part-of-speech tags, chunks, named entity tags, semantic roles, semantically similar words and the likelihood that the sentence makes sense (grammatically and semantically) using a language model.
background_label: The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning.
method_label: All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks.
result_label: We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance.

TITLE: A Bayesian Model for Unsupervised Semantic Parsing
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractWe propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic parsing.
method_label: Following Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (3) predict predicate-argument relations between the fragments.
method_label: We use hierarchical PitmanYor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations.
method_label: We develop a modification of the MetropolisHastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model.
result_label: The method is experimentally evaluated by using the induced semantic representation for the question answering task in the biomedical domain.

TITLE: An Iterative Deep Learning Framework for Unsupervised Discovery of Speech Features and Linguistic Units with Applications on Spoken Term Detection
ABSTRACT: objective_label: In this work we aim to discover high quality speech features and linguistic units directly from unlabeled speech data in a zero resource scenario.
background_label: The results are evaluated using the metrics and corpora proposed in the Zero Resource Speech Challenge organized at Interspeech 2015.
method_label: A Multi-layered Acoustic Tokenizer (MAT) was proposed for automatic discovery of multiple sets of acoustic tokens from the given corpus.
method_label: Each acoustic token set is specified by a set of hyperparameters that describe the model configuration.
method_label: These sets of acoustic tokens carry different characteristics fof the given corpus and the language behind, thus can be mutually reinforced.
method_label: The multiple sets of token labels are then used as the targets of a Multi-target Deep Neural Network (MDNN) trained on low-level acoustic features.
method_label: Bottleneck features extracted from the MDNN are then used as the feedback input to the MAT and the MDNN itself in the next iteration.
method_label: We call this iterative deep learning framework the Multi-layered Acoustic Tokenizing Deep Neural Network (MAT-DNN), which generates both high quality speech features for the Track 1 of the Challenge and acoustic tokens for the Track 2 of the Challenge.
method_label: In addition, we performed extra experiments on the same corpora on the application of query-by-example spoken term detection.
result_label: The experimental results showed the iterative deep learning framework of MAT-DNN improved the detection performance due to better underlying speech features and acoustic tokens.

TITLE: A Novel Approach to Auto Image Annotation Based on Pairwise Constrained Clustering and Semi-Na&#239;ve Bayesian Model
ABSTRACT: background_label: Automatic image annotation has been intensively studied for content-based image retrieval recently.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for this task.
method_label: Our approach first performs the segmentation of images into regions, followed by the clustering of regions, before learning the associations between concepts and region clusters using the set of training images with pre-assigned concepts.
objective_label: The main focus of this paper and our main contributions are as follows.
method_label: First, in the learning stage, we perform clustering of regions into region clusters by incorporating pair-wise constraints derived by considering the language model underlying the annotations assigned to training images.
method_label: Second, in the annotation stage, to alleviate the restriction of the independence assumption between region clusters, we develop a greedy selection and joining algorithm to find the independent sub-sets of region clusters and employ a semi-naïve Bayesian (SNB) model to compute the posterior probability of concepts given those independent sub-sets.
result_label: Experimental results show that our proposed system utilizing these two strategies outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in large image collection.

TITLE: A Unified Process Model of Syntactic and Semantic Error Recovery in Sentence Understanding
ABSTRACT: background_label: The development of models of human sentence processing has traditionally followed one of two paths.
background_label: Either the model posited a sequence of processing modules, each with its own task-specific knowledge (e.g., syntax and semantics), or it posited a single processor utilizing different types of knowledge inextricably integrated into a monolithic knowledge base.
background_label: Our previous work in modeling the sentence processor resulted in a model in which different processing modules used separate knowledge sources but operated in parallel to arrive at the interpretation of a sentence.
method_label: One highlight of this model is that it offered an explanation of how the sentence processor might recover from an error in choosing the meaning of an ambiguous word.
method_label: Recent experimental work by Laurie Stowe strongly suggests that the human sentence processor deals with syntactic error recovery using a mechanism very much like that proposed by our model of semantic error recovery.
method_label: Another way to interpret Stowe's finding is this: the human sentence processor consists of a single unified processing module utilizing multiple independent knowledge sources in parallel.
method_label: A sentence processor built upon this architecture should at times exhibit behavior associated with modular approaches, and at other times act like an integrated system.
result_label: In this paper we explore some of these ideas via a prototype computational model of sentence processing called COMPERE, and propose a set of psychological experiments for testing our theories.

TITLE: Video Event Understanding Using Natural Language Descriptions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Human action and role recognition play an important part in complex event understanding.
background_label: State-of-the-art methods learn action and role models from detailed spatio temporal annotations, which requires extensive human effort.
method_label: In this work, we propose a method to learn such models based on natural language descriptions of the training videos, which are easier to collect and scale with the number of actions and roles.
method_label: There are two challenges with using this form of weak supervision: First, these descriptions only provide a high-level summary and often do not directly mention the actions and roles occurring in a video.
method_label: Second, natural language descriptions do not provide spatio temporal annotations of actions and roles.
method_label: To tackle these challenges, we introduce a topic-based semantic relatedness (SR) measure between a video description and an action and role label, and incorporate it into a posterior regularization objective.
result_label: Our event recognition system based on these action and role models matches the state-of-the-art method on the TRECVID-MED11 event kit, despite weaker supervision.

TITLE: Learning Frames from Text with an Unsupervised Latent Variable Model
ABSTRACT: background_label: We develop a probabilistic latent-variable model to discover semantic frames---types of events and their participants---from corpora.

method_label: We analyze what the model learns, and compare it to FrameNet, noting it learns some novel and interesting frames.
result_label: This document also contains a discussion of inference issues, including concentration parameter learning; and a small-scale error analysis of syntactic parsing accuracy.

TITLE: A solution to Plato’s problem: The latent semantic analysis theory of acquisition, induction, and representation of knowledge
ABSTRACT: background_label: How do people know as much as they do with as little information as they get?
background_label: The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research.
method_label: A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena.
method_label: By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren.
method_label: LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts.
method_label: Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched.

TITLE: Memory-Based Dependency Parsing
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThis paper reports the results of experiments using memory-based learning to guide a deterministic dependency parser for unrestricted natural language text.
method_label: Using data from a small treebank of Swedish, memory-based classifiers for predicting the next action of the parser are constructed.
method_label: The accuracy of a classifier as such is evaluated on held-out data derived from the treebank, and its performance as a parser guide is evaluated by parsing the held-out portion of the treebank.
result_label: The evaluation shows that memory-based learning gives a signficant improvement over a previous probabilistic model based on maximum conditional likelihood estimation and that the inclusion of lexical features improves the accuracy even further.

TITLE: RolX: structural role extraction & mining in large graphs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Given a network, intuitively two nodes belong to the same role if they have similar structural behavior.
background_label: Roles should be automatically determined from the data, and could be, for example, "clique-members," "periphery-nodes," etc.
background_label: Roles enable numerous novel and useful network-mining tasks, such as sense-making, searching for similar nodes, and node classification.

method_label: We demonstrate the effectiveness of RolX on several network-mining tasks: from exploratory data analysis to network transfer learning.
method_label: Moreover, we compare network role discovery with network community discovery.

TITLE: Semantic Roles for SMT: A Hybrid Two-Pass Model
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present results on a novel hybrid semantic SMT model that incorporates the strengths of both semantic role labeling and phrase-based statistical machine translation.
method_label: The approach avoids major complexity limitations via a two-pass architecture.
method_label: The first pass is performed using a conventional phrase-based SMT model.
method_label: The second pass is performed by a re-ordering strategy guided by shallow semantic parsers that produce both semantic frame and role labels.
result_label: Evaluation on a Wall Street Journal newswire genre test set showed the hybrid model to yield an improvement of roughly half a point in BLEU score over a strong pure phrase-based SMT baseline -- to our knowledge, the first successful application of semantic role labeling to SMT.

TITLE: Thematic proto-roles and argument selection
ABSTRACT: background_label: As a novel attack on the perennially vexing questions of the theoretical status of thematic roles and the inventory of possible roles, this paper defends a strategy of basing accounts of roles on more unified domains of linguistic data than have been used in the past to motivate roles, addressing in particular the problem of ARGUMENT SELECTION (principles determining which roles are associated with which grammatical relations).
background_label: It is concluded that the best theory for describing this domain is not a traditional system of discrete roles (Agent, Patient, Source, etc.)
background_label: but a theory in which the only roles are two cluster-concepts called PROTO-AGENT and PROTO-PATIENT, each characterized by a set of verbal entailments: an argument of a verb may bear either of the two proto-roles (or both) to varying degrees, according to the number of entailments of each kind the verb gives it.
method_label: Both fine-grained and coarse-grained classes of verbal arguments (corresponding to traditional thematic roles and other classes as well) follow automatically, as do desired 'role hierarchies'.
background_label: By examining occurrences of the 'same' verb with different argument configurations—e.g.
method_label: two forms of psych predicates and object-oblique alternations as in the familiar spray/load class—it can also be argued that proto-roles act as defaults in the learning of lexical meanings.
method_label: Are proto-role categories manifested elsewhere in language or as cognitive categories?
result_label: If so, they might be a means of making grammar acquisition easier for the child, they might explain certain other typological and acquisitional observations, and they may lead to an account of contrasts between unaccusative and unergative intransitive verbs that does not rely on deriving unaccusatives from underlying direct objects.

background_label: These modeling components thus inherently reflect some function-based shape decomposition the artist had in mind during modeling.
background_label: On the other hand, modeling components represent an over-segmentation since a functional part is usually modeled as a multi-component assembly.
method_label: Based on these observations, we advocate that labeled segmentation of stock 3D models should not overlook the modeling components and propose a learning solution to grouping and labeling of the fine-grained components.
result_label: However, directly characterizing the shape of individual components for the purpose of labeling is unreliable, since they can be arbitrarily tiny and semantically meaningless.
objective_label: We propose to generate part hypotheses from the components based on a hierarchical grouping strategy, and perform labeling on those part groups instead of directly on the components.
background_label: Part hypotheses are mid-level elements which are more probable to carry semantic information.
method_label: A multiscale 3D convolutional neural network is trained to extract context-aware features for the hypotheses.
method_label: To accomplish a labeled segmentation of the whole shape, we formulate higher-order conditional random fields (CRFs) to infer an optimal label assignment for all components.
result_label: Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significantly robust labeling results on raw 3D models from public shape repositories.
result_label: Our work also contributes the first benchmark for component-wise labeling.

TITLE: Role Discovery in Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Roles represent node-level connectivity patterns such as star-center, star-edge nodes, near-cliques or nodes that act as bridges to different regions of the graph.
background_label: Intuitively, two nodes belong to the same role if they are structurally similar.
background_label: Roles have been mainly of interest to sociologists, but more recently, roles have become increasingly useful in other domains.
background_label: Traditionally, the notion of roles were defined based on graph equivalences such as structural, regular, and stochastic equivalences.
method_label: We briefly revisit these early notions and instead propose a more general formulation of roles based on the similarity of a feature representation (in contrast to the graph representation).
method_label: This leads us to propose a taxonomy of three general classes of techniques for discovering roles that includes (i) graph-based roles, (ii) feature-based roles, and (iii) hybrid roles.
method_label: We also propose a flexible framework for discovering roles using the notion of similarity on a feature-based representation.
method_label: The framework consists of two fundamental components: (a) role feature construction and (b) role assignment using the learned feature representation.
method_label: We discuss the different possibilities for discovering feature-based roles and the tradeoffs of the many techniques for computing them.
result_label: Finally, we discuss potential applications and future directions and challenges.

TITLE: Semantic Relation Classification via Bidirectional LSTM Networks with Entity-aware Attention using Latent Entity Typing
ABSTRACT: background_label: Classifying semantic relations between entity pairs in sentences is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
background_label: Most previous models for relation classification rely on the high-level lexical and syntactic features obtained by NLP tools such as WordNet, dependency parser, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and named entity recognizers (NER).
background_label: In addition, state-of-the-art neural models based on attention mechanisms do not fully utilize information of entity that may be the most crucial features for relation classification.
method_label: To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end recurrent neural model which incorporates an entity-aware attention mechanism with a latent entity typing (LET) method.
method_label: Our model not only utilizes entities and their latent types as features effectively but also is more interpretable by visualizing attention mechanisms applied to our model and results of LET.
result_label: Experimental results on the SemEval-2010 Task 8, one of the most popular relation classification task, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models without any high-level features.

TITLE: EFFECTIVE STATISTICAL MODELS FOR SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC DISAMBIGUATION
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This thesis focuses on building effective statistical models for disambiguation of sophisticated syntactic and semantic natural language (NL) structures.
background_label: We advance the state of the art in several domains by (i) choosing representations that encode domain knowledge more effectively and (ii) developing machine learning algorithms that deal with the specific properties of NL disambiguation tasks—sparsity of training data and large, structured spaces of hidden labels.
method_label: For the task of syntactic disambiguation, we propose a novel representation of parse trees that connects the words of the sentence with the hidden syntactic structure in a direct way.
result_label: Experimental evaluation on parse selection for a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar shows the new representation achieves superior performance compared to previous models.
method_label: For the task of disambiguating the semantic role structure of verbs, we build a more accurate model, which captures the knowledge that the semantic frame of a verb is a joint structure with strong dependencies between arguments.
method_label: We achieve this using a Conditional Random Field without Markov independence assumptions on the sequence of semantic role labels.
method_label: To address the sparsity problem in machine learning for NL, we develop a method for incorporating many additional sources of information, using Markov chains in the space of words.
method_label: The Markov chain framework makes it possible to combine multiple knowledge sources, to learn how much to trust each of them, and to chain inferences together.
result_label: It achieves large gains in the task of disambiguating prepositional phrase attachments.

TITLE: Domain Adaptation with Artificial Data for Semantic Parsing of Speech
ABSTRACT: background_label: We adapt a semantic role parser to the domain of goal-directed speech by creating an artificial treebank from an existing text tree-bank.
method_label: We use a three-component model that includes distributional models from both target and source domains.
result_label: We show that we improve the parser's performance on utterances collected from human-machine dialogues by training on the artificially created data without loss of performance on the text treebank.

TITLE: A Semi-Automatic Approach for Syntax Error Reporting and Recovery in Parsing Expression Grammars
ABSTRACT: background_label: Error recovery is an essential feature for a parser that should be plugged in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which must build Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) even for syntactically invalid programs in order to offer features such as automated refactoring and code completion.
background_label: Parsing Expressions Grammars (PEGs) are a formalism that naturally describes recursive top-down parsers using a restricted form of backtracking.
background_label: Labeled failures are a conservative extension of PEGs that adds an error reporting mechanism for PEG parsers, and these labels can also be associated with recovery expressions to provide an error recovery mechanism.
background_label: These expressions can use the full expressivity of PEGs to recover from syntactic errors.
background_label: Manually annotating a large grammar with labels and recovery expressions can be difficult.
objective_label: In this work, we present two approaches, Standard and Unique, to automatically annotate a PEG with labels, and to build their corresponding recovery expressions.
method_label: The Standard approach annotates a grammar in a way similar to manual annotation, but it may insert labels incorrectly, while the Unique approach is more conservative to annotate a grammar and does not insert labels incorrectly.
result_label: We evaluate both approaches by using them to generate error recovering parsers for four programming languages: Titan, C, Pascal and Java.
result_label: In our evaluation, the parsers produced using the Standard approach, after a manual intervention to remove the labels incorrectly added, gave an acceptable recovery for at least 70% of the files in each language.
result_label: By it turn, the acceptable recovery rate of the parsers produced via the Unique approach, without the need of manual intervention, ranged from 41% to 76%.

TITLE: A general framework for induction and a study of selective induction
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper has two major parts.
background_label: The first is an extensive analysis of the problem of induction, and the second part is a detailed study of selective induction.
method_label: Throughout the paper we integrate a number of notions, mainly from artificial intelligence, but also from pattern recognition and cognitive psychology.
method_label: The result is a synthetic view which exploits uncertainty, task-guidance, and biases such as language restriction.
objective_label: Some of the main themes and contributions are as follows.
method_label: (1) Practical induction is really a problem of efficacy and efficiency (power).
result_label: (2) Search in a space of hypothetical concepts is governed by acredibility function which combines various knowledge sources in a single subjective probability or belief measure μ.
background_label: (3) The amount of knowledge supplied by various sources can often be quantified; these sources include various biases and the learning system itself.
background_label: (4) Induction is equivalent to discovery of autility function u, which captures the purpose or goal of induction.
background_label: (5) The difficulty of induction may be characterized by the form of u.
method_label: Smooth or coherent functions mean selective induction, which has had the most attention in machine learning.
method_label: (6) Systems for selective induction are more similar than commonly understood.
method_label: By juxtaposing them we can discover similarities and improvements.
result_label: (7) Our analysis suggests a number of incipient principles for powerful induction.

TITLE: Joint RNN Model for Argument Component Boundary Detection
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Argument Component Boundary Detection (ACBD) is an important sub-task in argumentation mining; it aims at identifying the word sequences that constitute argument components, and is usually considered as the first sub-task in the argumentation mining pipeline.
background_label: Existing ACBD methods heavily depend on task-specific knowledge, and require considerable human efforts on feature-engineering.
method_label: To tackle these problems, in this work, we formulate ACBD as a sequence labeling problem and propose a variety of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based methods, which do not use domain specific or handcrafted features beyond the relative position of the sentence in the document.
method_label: In particular, we propose a novel joint RNN model that can predict whether sentences are argumentative or not, and use the predicted results to more precisely detect the argument component boundaries.
result_label: We evaluate our techniques on two corpora from two different genres; results suggest that our joint RNN model obtain the state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

TITLE: A Microphotonic Astrocomb
ABSTRACT: background_label: One of the essential prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers.
background_label: It has already been realized that the large number of exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as calibration light sources.
background_label: A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers.
method_label: Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23.7 GHz.
method_label: This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer.
result_label: As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research.

TITLE: Corpus Expansion for Statistical Machine Translation with Semantic Role Label Substitution Rules
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractWe present an approach of expanding parallel corpora for machine translation.
method_label: By utilizing Semantic role labeling (SRL) on one side of the language pair, we extract SRL substitution rules from existing parallel corpus.
method_label: The rules are then used for generating new sentence pairs.
method_label: An SVM classifier is built to filter the generated sentence pairs.
method_label: The filtered corpus is used for training phrase-based translation models, which can be used directly in translation tasks or combined with baseline models.
result_label: Experimental results on ChineseEnglish machine translation tasks show an average improvement of 0.45 BLEU and 1.22 TER points across 5 different NIST test sets.

TITLE: Exploiting Acoustic and Syntactic Features for Prosody Labeling in a Maximum Entropy Framework
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractIn this paper we describe an automatic prosody labeling framework that exploits both language and speech information.
method_label: We model the syntactic-prosodic information with a maximum entropy model that achieves an accuracy of 85.2% and 91.5% for pitch accent and boundary tone labeling on the Boston University Radio News corpus.
method_label: We model the acousticprosodic stream with two different models, one a maximum entropy model and the other a traditional HMM.
method_label: We finally couple the syntactic-prosodic and acousticprosodic components to achieve significantly improved pitch accent and boundary tone classification accuracies of 86.0% and 93.1% respectively.
result_label: Similar experimental results are also reported on Boston Directions corpus.

TITLE: Unsupervised Induction of Frame-Semantic Representations
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThe frame-semantic parsing task is challenging for supervised techniques, even for those few languages where relatively large amounts of labeled data are available.
background_label: In this preliminary work, we consider unsupervised induction of frame-semantic representations.
method_label: An existing state-of-the-art Bayesian model for PropBank-style unsupervised semantic role induction (Titov and Klementiev, 2012 ) is extended to jointly induce semantic frames and their roles.
result_label: We evaluate the model performance both quantitatively and qualitatively by comparing the induced representation against FrameNet annotations.

TITLE: Unsupervised adaptation of deep neural networks for sound source localization using entropy minimization
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper describes an unsupervised method of adapting deep neural networks (DNNs) for sound source localization (SSL).
background_label: DNNs-based SSL achieves high localization accuracy for sound data that are similar to training data.
background_label: However, the accuracy deteriorates if a sound source is at an unknown position in unknown reverberant environments.
method_label: We solve the problem by using unsupervised adaption of the DNNs' parameters to the observed sound signals.
method_label: Entropy is used as the objective function and minimized to optimize the parameters on the basis of the gradient method.
method_label: Adaptation without overfitting is achieved by using 1) a parameter adaptation layer, such as linear transform network, and 2) early stopping of the parameter updates.
result_label: Experimental results indicated that our method improved localization accuracy by a maximum of 20 points for unknown positions and reverberant data.

TITLE: Towards role-based filtering of disease outbreak reports.
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper explores the role of named entities (NEs) in the classification of disease outbreak report.
method_label: In the annotation schema of BioCaster, a text mining system for public health protection, important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases were conceptually analyzed with a formal ontological methodology and classified into types and roles.
method_label: Types are specified as NE classes and roles are integrated into NEs as attributes such as a chemical and whether it is being used as a therapy for some infectious disease.
objective_label: We focus on the roles of NEs and explore different ways to extract, combine and use them as features in a text classifier.
method_label: In addition, we investigate the combination of roles with semantic categories of disease-related nouns and verbs.
result_label: Experimental results using naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms show that: (1) roles in combination with NEs improve performance in text classification, (2) roles in combination with semantic categories of noun and verb features contribute substantially to the improvement of text classification.
result_label: Both these results were statistically significant compared to the baseline "raw text" representation.
result_label: We discuss in detail the effects of roles on each NE and on semantic categories of noun and verb features in terms of accuracy, precision/recall and F-score measures for the text classification task.

TITLE: Discriminative Word Alignment by Linear Modeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Word alignment plays an important role in many NLP tasks as it indicates the correspondence between words in a parallel text.
background_label: Although widely used to align large bilingual corpora, generative models are hard to extend to incorporate arbitrary useful linguistic information.
objective_label: This article presents a discriminative framework for word alignment based on a linear model.
method_label: Within this framework, all knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on a source language sentence, a target language sentence, and the alignment between them.
method_label: We describe a number of features that could produce symmetric alignments.
method_label: Our model is easy to extend and can be optimized with respect to evaluation metrics directly.
method_label: The model achieves state-of-the-art alignment quality on three word alignment shared tasks for five language pairs with varying divergence and richness of resources.
result_label: We further show that our approach improves translation performance for various statistical machine translation systems.

TITLE: Unsupervised Induction of Cross-Lingual Semantic Relations
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractCreating a language-independent meaning representation would benefit many crosslingual NLP tasks.
method_label: We introduce the first unsupervised approach to this problem, learning clusters of semantically equivalent English and French relations between referring expressions, based on their named-entity arguments in large monolingual corpora.
method_label: The clusters can be used as language-independent semantic relations, by mapping clustered expressions in different languages onto the same relation.
method_label: Our approach needs no parallel text for training, but outperforms a baseline that uses machine translation on a cross-lingual question answering task.
method_label: We also show how to use the semantics to improve the accuracy of machine translation, by using it in a simple reranker.
