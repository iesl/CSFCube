TITLE: Modelling Protagonist Goals and Desires in First-Person Narrative
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many genres of natural language text are narratively structured, a testament to our predilection for organizing our experiences as narratives.
background_label: There is broad consensus that understanding a narrative requires identifying and tracking the goals and desires of the characters and their narrative outcomes.
background_label: However, to date, there has been limited work on computational models for this problem.
method_label: We introduce a new dataset, DesireDB, which includes gold-standard labels for identifying statements of desire, textual evidence for desire fulfillment, and annotations for whether the stated desire is fulfilled given the evidence in the narrative context.
result_label: We report experiments on tracking desire fulfillment using different methods, and show that LSTM Skip-Thought model achieves F-measure of 0.7 on our corpus.

TITLE: Ask, and shall you receive?: Understanding Desire Fulfillment in Natural Language Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: The ability to comprehend wishes or desires and their fulfillment is important to Natural Language Understanding.
objective_label: This paper introduces the task of identifying if a desire expressed by a subject in a given short piece of text was fulfilled.
method_label: We propose various unstructured and structured models that capture fulfillment cues such as the subject's emotional state and actions.
result_label: Our experiments with two different datasets demonstrate the importance of understanding the narrative and discourse structure to address this task.

TITLE: Modeling Dynamic Relationships Between Characters in Literary Novels
ABSTRACT: background_label: Studying characters plays a vital role in computationally representing and interpreting narratives.
background_label: Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships.
objective_label: Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem.
method_label: We propose a semi-supervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data.
method_label: We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes.
method_label: We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative.
result_label: We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.

TITLE: Computational Modeling of Narrative
ABSTRACT: background_label: The field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation is one of the oldest in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which is hardly surprising, since storytelling is such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and social activity.
background_label: In recent years, the demands of interactive entertainment and interest in the creation of engaging narratives with life-like characters have provided a fresh impetus to this field.
objective_label: This book provides an overview of the principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in modeling the narrative structure of stories.
method_label: The book introduces classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their mapping to computational approaches.
method_label: It demonstrates how research in AI and NLP has modeled character goals, causality, and time using formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning, and temporal reasoning, and discusses fundamental limitations in such approaches.
result_label: It proposes new representations for embedded narratives and fictional entities, for assessing the pace of a narrative, and offers an empirical theory of audience response.
background_label: These notions are incorporated into an annotation scheme called Narrative ML.
background_label: The book identifies key issues that need to be addressed, including annotation methods for long literary narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and characterizing the goals of narrators.
background_label: It also suggests a future characterized by advanced text mining of narrative structure from large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of useful authoring aids.
objective_label: This is the first book to provide a systematic foundation that integrates together narratology, AI, and computational linguistics.
method_label: It can serve as a narratology primer for computer scientists and an elucidation of computational narratology for literary theorists.
result_label: It is written in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a broad scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and formal semanticists), AI researchers, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.

TITLE: LSDSem 2017 Shared Task: The Story Cloze Test
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThe LSDSem'17 shared task is the Story Cloze Test, a new evaluation for story understanding and script learning.
background_label: This test provides a system with a four-sentence story and two possible endings, and the system must choose the correct ending to the story.
background_label: Successful narrative understanding (getting closer to human performance of 100%) requires systems to link various levels of semantics to commonsense knowledge.
method_label: A total of eight systems participated in the shared task, with a variety of approaches including end-to-end neural networks, feature-based regression models, and rule-based methods.
result_label: The highest performing system achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, a substantial improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

TITLE: Inferring Interpersonal Relations in Narrative Summaries
ABSTRACT: background_label: Characterizing relationships between people is fundamental for the understanding of narratives.
objective_label: In this work, we address the problem of inferring the polarity of relationships between people in narrative summaries.
method_label: We formulate the problem as a joint structured prediction for each narrative, and present a model that combines evidence from linguistic and semantic features, as well as features based on the structure of the social community in the text.
method_label: We also provide a clustering-based approach that can exploit regularities in narrative types.
method_label: e.g., learn an affinity for love-triangles in romantic stories.
result_label: On a dataset of movie summaries from Wikipedia, our structured models provide more than a 30% error-reduction over a competitive baseline that considers pairs of characters in isolation.

TITLE: Modeling Naive Psychology of Characters in Simple Commonsense Stories
ABSTRACT: background_label: Understanding a narrative requires reading between the lines and reasoning about the unspoken but obvious implications about events and people's mental states - a capability that is trivial for humans but remarkably hard for machines.
method_label: To facilitate research addressing this challenge, we introduce a new annotation framework to explain naive psychology of story characters as fully-specified chains of mental states with respect to motivations and emotional reactions.
result_label: Our work presents a new large-scale dataset with rich low-level annotations and establishes baseline performance on several new tasks, suggesting avenues for future research.

TITLE: Telling the American story : a structural and cultural analysis of conversational storytelling
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This book explores the complexity of story text.
objective_label: Its thesis is that one can elicit the world view of a people from a close structural analysis of their narrative discourse.
method_label: It is the first methodological explanation of how stories can be used as a source of cultural data and an illustration of how to do a rhetorically close analysis of a story text.
method_label: A theory of narrative structure is presented which leads to a conversationally based definition of what can properly be called a story.

TITLE: Crowdsourcing Narrative Intelligence
ABSTRACT: background_label: Narrative intelligence is an important part of human cognition, especially in sensemaking and communicating with people.
background_label: Humans draw on a lifetime of relevant experiences to explain stories, to tell stories, and to help choose the most appropriate actions in real-life settings.
background_label: Manual authoring the required knowledge presents a significant bottleneck in the creation of systems demonstrating narrative intelligence.
objective_label: In this paper, we describe a novel technique for automatically learning script-like narrative knowledge from crowdsourcing.
method_label: By leveraging human workers’ collective understanding of social and procedural constructs, we can learn a potentially unlimited range of scripts regarding how real-world situations unfold.
result_label: We present quantitative evaluations of the learned primitive events and the temporal ordering of events, which suggest we can identify orderings between events with high accuracy.

TITLE: Identifying Narrative Clause Types in Personal Stories
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper describes work on automatically identifying categories of narrative clauses in personal stories written by ordinary people about their daily lives and experiences.
method_label: We base our approach on Labov & Waletzky’s theory of oral narrative which categorizes narrative clauses into subtypes, such as ORIENTATION, ACTION and EVALUATION.
method_label: We describe an experiment where we annotate 50 personal narratives from weblogs and experiment with methods for achieving higher annotation reliability.
method_label: We use the resulting annotated corpus to train a classifier to automatically identify narrative categories, achieving a best average F-score of .658, which rises to an F-score of .767 on the cases with the highest annotator agreement.
result_label: We believe the identified narrative structure will enable new types of computational analysis of narrative discourse.

TITLE: Affective Ludology, Flow and Immersion in a First- Person Shooter: Measurement of Player Experience
ABSTRACT: background_label: Gameplay research about experiential phenomena is a challenging undertaking, given the variety of experiences that gamers encounter when playing and which currently do not have a formal taxonomy, such as flow, immersion, boredom, and fun.
background_label: These informal terms require a scientific explanation.
background_label: Ludologists also acknowledge the need to understand cognition, emotion, and goal- oriented behavior of players from a psychological perspective by establishing rigorous methodologies.
objective_label: This paper builds upon and extends prior work in an area for which we would like to coin the term"affective ludology.
objective_label: "The area is concerned with the affective measurement of player-game interaction.
method_label: The experimental study reported here investigated different traits of gameplay experience using subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e., psychophysiological) measures.
method_label: Participants played three Half-Life 2 game level design modifications while measures such as electromyography (EMG), electrodermal activity (EDA) were taken and questionnaire responses were collected.
result_label: A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated significant high-arousal positive affect emotions.
result_label: This method shows that emotional patterns emerge from different level designs, which has great potential for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be generated together with self- reported subjective player experience descriptions.

TITLE: Rational quantitative attribution of beliefs, desires and percepts in human mentalizing
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social cognition depends on our capacity for ‘mentalizing’, or explaining an agent’s behaviour in terms of their mental states.
background_label: The development and neural substrates of mentalizing are well-studied, but its computational basis is only beginning to be probed.
objective_label: Here we present a model of core mentalizing computations: inferring jointly an actor’s beliefs, desires and percepts from how they move in the local spatial environment.
method_label: Our Bayesian theory of mind (BToM) model is based on probabilistically inverting artificial-intelligence approaches to rational planning and state estimation, which extend classical expected-utility agent models to sequential actions in complex, partially observable domains.
method_label: The model accurately captures the quantitative mental-state judgements of human participants in two experiments, each varying multiple stimulus dimensions across a large number of stimuli.
result_label: Comparative model fits with both simpler ‘lesioned’ BToM models and a family of simpler non-mentalistic motion features reveal the value contributed by each component of our model.

TITLE: Mapping Out Narrative Structures and Dynamics Using Networks and Textual Information
ABSTRACT: background_label: Human communication is often executed in the form of a narrative, an account of connected events composed of characters, actions, and settings.
background_label: A coherent narrative structure is therefore a requisite for a well-formulated narrative -- be it fictional or nonfictional -- for informative and effective communication, opening up the possibility of a deeper understanding of a narrative by studying its structural properties.
method_label: In this paper we present a network-based framework for modeling and analyzing the structure of a narrative, which is further expanded by incorporating methods from computational linguistics to utilize the narrative text.
method_label: Modeling a narrative as a dynamically unfolding system, we characterize its progression via the growth patterns of the character network, and use sentiment analysis and topic modeling to represent the actual content of the narrative in the form of interaction maps between characters with associated sentiment values and keywords.
method_label: This is a network framework advanced beyond the simple occurrence-based one most often used until now, allowing one to utilize the unique characteristics of a given narrative to a high degree.
result_label: Given the ubiquity and importance of narratives, such advanced network-based representation and analysis framework may lead to a more systematic modeling and understanding of narratives for social interactions, expression of human sentiments, and communication.

TITLE: Strategies for Structuring Story Generation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Writers generally rely on plans or sketches to write long stories, but most current language models generate word by word from left to right.
objective_label: We explore coarse-to-fine models for creating narrative texts of several hundred words, and introduce new models which decompose stories by abstracting over actions and entities.
method_label: The model first generates the predicate-argument structure of the text, where different mentions of the same entity are marked with placeholder tokens.
method_label: It then generates a surface realization of the predicate-argument structure, and finally replaces the entity placeholders with context-sensitive names and references.
method_label: Human judges prefer the stories from our models to a wide range of previous approaches to hierarchical text generation.
result_label: Extensive analysis shows that our methods can help improve the diversity and coherence of events and entities in generated stories.

TITLE: Minimal Narrative Annotation Schemes and Their Applications
ABSTRACT: background_label: The increased use of large corpora in narrative research has created new opportunities for empirical research and intelligent narrative technologies.
background_label: To best exploit the value of these corpora, several research groups are eschewing complex discourse analysis techniques in favor of high-level minimalist narrative annotation schemes that can be quickly applied, achieve high inter-rater agreement, and are amenable to automation using machine-learning techniques.
method_label: In this paper we compare different annotation schemes that have been employed by two groups of researchers to annotate large corpora of narrative text.
method_label: Using a dual-annotation methodology, we investigate the correlation between narrative clauses distinguished by their structural role (orientation, action, evaluation), their subjectivity, and their narrative level within the discourse.
result_label: We find that each simple narrative annotation scheme captures a structurally distinct characteristic of real-world narratives, and each combination of labels is evident in a corpus of 19 weblog narratives (951 narrative clauses).
result_label: We discuss several potential applications of minimalist narrative annotation schemes, noting the combination of label across these two annotation schemes that best support each task.

TITLE: From Desires, Obligations and Norms to Goals
ABSTRACT: background_label: Traditional models of agents based on Beliefs, Desires and Intentions usually  only include either desires or goals.
background_label: Therefore the process whereby goals  arise from desires is given scant attention.
objective_label: In this paper we argue that the  inclusion of both desires and goals in the same model can be important,  particularly in a Multi-Agent System context, where other sources of  individual motivation such as obligations and norms may be present.
objective_label: This  leads us to propose an extended BDI architecture in which obligations, norms  and desires are distinguished from goals and explicitly represented.
method_label: In this  paper we consider suitable logical representations for and properties of these  elements, and describe the basic method of operation of the architecture,  focusing on how goal generation and goal maintenance may occur.

TITLE: Plot Units and Narrative Summarization
ABSTRACT: background_label: In order to summarize a story, it is necessary to access a high level analysis of the story that highlights its central concepts.
background_label: A technique of memory representation based on plot units appears to provide a rich foundation for such an analysis.
method_label: Plot units are conceptual structures that overlap with each other when a narrative is cohesive.
method_label: When overlapping intersections between plot units are interpreted as arcs in a graph of plot units, the resulting graph encodes the plot of the story.
method_label: Structural features of the graph then reveal which concepts are central to the story, and which concepts are peripheral.
result_label: Plot unit analysis is currently being investigated as a processing strategy for narrative summarization by both computer simulation and psychological experiments.

TITLE: Annotating High-Level Structures of Short Stories and Personal Anecdotes
ABSTRACT: background_label: Stories are a vital form of communication in human culture; they are employed daily to persuade, to elicit sympathy, or to convey a message.
background_label: Computational understanding of human narratives, especially high-level narrative structures, remain limited to date.
background_label: Multiple literary theories for narrative structures exist, but operationalization of the theories has remained a challenge.
method_label: We developed an annotation scheme by consolidating and extending existing narratological theories, including Labov and Waletsky's (1967) functional categorization scheme and Freytag's (1863) pyramid of dramatic tension, and present 360 annotated short stories collected from online sources.
result_label: In the future, this research will support an approach that enables systems to intelligently sustain complex communications with humans.

TITLE: Unsupervised Learning of Narrative Event Chains
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractHand-coded scripts were used in the 1970-80s as knowledge backbones that enabled inference and other NLP tasks requiring deep semantic knowledge.
objective_label: We propose unsupervised induction of similar schemata called narrative event chains from raw newswire text.A narrative event chain is a partially ordered set of events related by a common protagonist.
method_label: We describe a three step process to learning narrative event chains.
method_label: The first uses unsupervised distributional methods to learn narrative relations between events sharing coreferring arguments.
method_label: The second applies a temporal classifier to partially order the connected events.
method_label: Finally, the third prunes and clusters self-contained chains from the space of events.
result_label: We introduce two evaluations: the narrative cloze to evaluate event relatedness, and an order coherence task to evaluate narrative order.
result_label: We show a 36% improvement over baseline for narrative prediction and 25% for temporal coherence.

TITLE: An ASP Methodology for Understanding Narratives about Stereotypical Activities
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe an application of Answer Set Programming to the understanding of narratives about stereotypical activities, demonstrated via question answering.
background_label: Substantial work in this direction was done by Erik Mueller, who modeled stereotypical activities as scripts.
background_label: His systems were able to understand a good number of narratives, but could not process texts describing exceptional scenarios.
objective_label: We propose addressing this problem by using a theory of intentions developed by Blount, Gelfond, and Balduccini.
method_label: We present a methodology in which we substitute scripts by activities (i.e., hierarchical plans associated with goals) and employ the concept of an intentional agent to reason about both normal and exceptional scenarios.
method_label: We exemplify the application of this methodology by answering questions about a number of restaurant stories.
result_label: This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

TITLE: Modeling Narrative Discourse
ABSTRACT: background_label: This thesis describes new approaches to the formal modeling of narrative discourse.
background_label: Although narratives of all kinds are ubiquitous in daily life, contemporary text processing techniques typically do not leverage the aspects that separate narrative from expository discourse.
objective_label: We describe two approaches to the problem.
method_label: The first approach considers the conversational networks to be found in literary fiction as a key aspect of discourse coherence; by isolating and analyzing these networks, we are able to comment on longstanding literary theories.
method_label: The second approach proposes a new set of discourse relations that are specific to narrative.
method_label: By focusing on certain key aspects, such as agentive characters, goals, plans, beliefs, and time, these relations represent a theory-of-mind interpretation of a text.
method_label: We show that these discourse relations are expressive, formal, robust, and through the use of a software system, amenable to corpus collection projects through the use of trained annotators.
method_label: We have procured and released a collection of over 100 encodings, covering a set of fables as well as longer texts including literary fiction and epic poetry.
result_label: We are able to inferentially find similarities and analogies between encoded stories based on the proposed relations, and an evaluation of this technique shows that human raters prefer such a measure of similarity to a more traditional one based on the semantic distances between story propositions.

TITLE: Narrative framing of consumer sentiment in online restaurant reviews
ABSTRACT: background_label: The vast increase in online expressions of consumer sentiment offers a powerful new tool for studying consumer attitudes.
background_label: To explore the narratives that consumers use to frame positive and negative sentiment online, we computationally investigate linguistic structure in 900,000 online restaurant reviews.
method_label: Negative reviews, especially in expensive restaurants, were more likely to use features previously associated with narratives of trauma : negative emotional vocabulary, a focus on the past actions of third person actors such as waiters, and increased use of references to “we” and “us”, suggesting that negative reviews function as a means of coping with service–related trauma.
method_label: Positive reviews also employed framings contextualized by expense: inexpensive restaurant reviews use the language of addiction to frame the reviewer as craving fatty or starchy foods.
result_label: Positive reviews of expensive restaurants were long narratives using long words emphasizing the reviewer’s linguistic capital and also focusing on sensory pleasure .
result_label: Our results demonstrate that portraying the self, whether as well–educated, as a victim, or even as addicted to chocolate, is a key function of reviews and suggests the important role of online reviews in exploring social psychological variables.

TITLE: Modeling Reportable Events as Turning Points in Narrative
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present novel experiments in modeling the rise and fall of story characteristics within narrative, leading up to the Most Reportable Event (MRE), the compelling event that is the nucleus of the story.
method_label: We construct a corpus of personal narratives from the bulletin board website Reddit, using the organization of Reddit content into topic-specific communities to automatically identify narratives.
method_label: Leveraging the structure of Reddit comment threads, we automatically label a large dataset of narratives.
method_label: We present a change-based model of narrative that tracks changes in formality, affect, and other characteristics over the course of a story, and we use this model in distant supervision and selftraining experiments that achieve significant improvements over the baselines at the task of identifying MREs.

TITLE: Generating and evaluating evaluative arguments
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractEvaluative arguments are pervasive in natural human communication.
background_label: In countless situations people attempt to advise or persuade their interlocutors that something is desirable (vs. undesirable) or right (vs. wrong).
background_label: With the proliferation of on-line systems serving as personal advisors and assistants, there is a pressing need to develop general and testable computational models for generating and presenting evaluative arguments.
objective_label: Previous research on generating evaluative arguments has been characterized by two major limitations.
method_label: First, researchers have tended to focus only on specific aspects of the generation process.
method_label: Second, the proposed approaches were not empirically tested.
method_label: The research presented in this paper addresses both limitations.
method_label: We have designed and implemented a complete computational model for generating evaluative arguments.
background_label: For content selection and organization, we devised an argumentation strategy based on guidelines from argumentation theory.
background_label: For expressing the content in natural language, we extended and integrated previous work in computational linguistics on generating evaluative arguments.
background_label: The key knowledge source for both tasks is a quantitative model of user preferences.
method_label: To empirically test critical aspects of our generation model, we have devised and implemented an evaluation framework in which the effectiveness of evaluative arguments can be measured with real users.
method_label: Within the framework, we have performed an experiment to test two basic hypotheses on which the design of the computational model is based; namely, that our proposal for tailoring an evaluative argument to the addressee's preferences increases its effectiveness, and that differences in conciseness significantly influence argument effectiveness.
result_label: The second hypothesis was confirmed in the experiment.
result_label: In contrast, the first hypothesis was only marginally confirmed.
result_label: However, independent testing by other researchers has recently provided further support for this hypothesis.

TITLE: Predilections for Narrative Outcomes: The Impact of Story Contexts and Reader Preferences.
ABSTRACT: background_label: As readers experience narratives, they have ample opportunities to generate expectations about likely outcomes.
background_label: We suggest that past research on such expectations has ignored the extent to which readers bring their own preferences to bear on those outcomes.
method_label: In four experiments, we demonstrate that reader preferences can influence expectations for future narrative events.
method_label: In Experiments 1 and 2, readers made explicit judgments about the likelihood of narrative outcomes.
method_label: They tended to agree with outcomes consistent with prior story contexts but also consistent with preferences.
result_label: In Experiments 3 and 4, we provide converging evidence for these effects by analyzing reading times for outcomes.
result_label: Participants were slower to read outcomes inconsistent with prior story contexts and preferences.
result_label: Our results suggest that theories of narrative comprehension must include some notion of reader wishes and desires to adequately describe the types of outcome expectations readers use during narrative experiences.

method_label: We create a system called AESOP that exploits a variety of existing resources to identify affect states and applies "projection rules" to map the affect states onto the characters in a story.
method_label: We also use corpus-based techniques to generate a new type of affect knowledge base: verbs that impart positive or negative states onto their patients (e.g., being eaten is an undesirable state, but being fed is a desirable state).
method_label: We harvest these "patient polarity verbs" from a Web corpus using two techniques: co-occurrence with Evil/Kind Agent patterns, and bootstrapping over conjunctions of verbs.
result_label: We evaluate the plot unit representations produced by our system on a small collection of Aesop's fables.

TITLE: Who Feels What and Why? Annotation of a Literature Corpus with Semantic Roles of Emotions
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractMost approaches to emotion analysis in fictional texts focus on detecting the emotion expressed in text.
background_label: We argue that this is a simplification which leads to an overgeneralized interpretation of the results, as it does not take into account who experiences an emotion and why.
background_label: Emotions play a crucial role in the interaction between characters and the events they are involved in.
background_label: Until today, no specific corpora that capture such an interaction were available for literature.
objective_label: We aim at filling this gap and present a publicly available corpus based on Project Gutenberg, REMAN (Relational EMotion ANnotation), manually annotated for spans which correspond to emotion trigger phrases and entities/events in the roles of experiencers, targets, and causes of the emotion.
result_label: We provide baseline results for the automatic prediction of these relational structures and show that emotion lexicons are not able to encompass the high variability of emotion expressions and demonstrate that statistical models benefit from joint modeling of emotions with its roles in all subtasks.
result_label: The corpus that we provide enables future research on the recognition of emotions and associated entities in text.
result_label: It supports qualitative literary studies and digital humanities.
other_label: The corpus is available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/reman.

TITLE: Sociable killers: understanding social relationships in an online first-person shooter game
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online video games can be seen as medium for the formation and maintenance of social relationships.
objective_label: In this paper, we explore what social relationships mean under the context of online First-Person Shooter (FPS) games, how these relationships influence game experience, and how players manage them.
result_label: We combine qualitative interview and quantitative game log data, and find that despite the gap between the non-persistent game world and potentially persistent social relationships, a diversity of social relationships emerge and they play a central role in the enjoyment of online FPS games.
result_label: We report the forms, development, and impact of such relationships, and discuss our findings in light of design implications and comparison with other game genres.

TITLE: Qualitative HCI Research: Going Behind the Scenes
ABSTRACT: background_label: HCI addresses problems of interaction design: evaluating existing designs, delivering novel designs, and understanding user needs for future designs.
background_label: Qualitative methods have an essential role to play in this enterprise, particularly in understanding user needs and behaviors and evaluating situated use of technology.
background_label: In this lecture, we draw on the analogy of making a documentary film: historically, the film was presented as a finished product, giving the viewer little insight into the production process; more recently, there has been a trend to go 'behind the scenes' to expose some of the painstaking work that went into creating the raw footage behind the film; but still much essential work remains hidden.
background_label: Similarly, in qualitative research, the essential work 'behind the scenes' is rarely discussed.
background_label: There are many "how to" guides for particular methods, but few texts that discuss the important details of how to select a suitable method, how to adapt it to fit the study context, or how to deal with unexpected challenges that arise.
method_label: We address this gap by presenting a repertoire of techniques for understanding user needs, practices and experiences with technology, including practical considerations such as tactics for recruiting participants when aiming for a particular sampling strategy, and ways of getting started when faced with a pile of interview transcripts.
method_label: We present illustrative case studies drawn from prior experience.
method_label: Our particular focus is on semi-structured qualitative studies, which occupy a space between ethnography and surveys, typically involving observations, interviews and similar methods for data gathering, and methods for analysis based on systematic coding of data.
result_label: Just as a documentary team faces challenges that often go unreported when arranging expeditions or interviews, gathering footage or editing the story, within time and budget pressures, so the qualitative research team faces challenge in obtaining ethic

TITLE: Flow and immersion in first-person shooters: measuring the player's gameplay experience
ABSTRACT: background_label: Researching experiential phenomena is a challenging undertaking, given the sheer variety of experiences that are described by gamers and missing a formal taxonomy: flow, immersion, boredom, excitement, challenge, and fun.
background_label: These informal terms require scientific explanation, which amounts to providing measurable criteria for different experiential states.
objective_label: This paper reports the results of an experimental psychophysiological study investigating different traits of gameplay experience using subjective and objective measures.
method_label: Participants played three Half-Life 2 game modifications while being measured with electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography, galvanic skin response and eye tracking equipment.
method_label: In addition, questionnaire responses were collected after each play session.
result_label: A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated measurable high-arousal positive affect emotions.
result_label: The positive correlation between subjective and objective indicators of gameplay experience shows the great potential of the method presented here for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be correlated with self-reported subjective descriptions.

TITLE: MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text.
background_label: Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction).
method_label: In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension.
method_label: Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric.
method_label: By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself.
method_label: The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task.
method_label: We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions.
method_label: By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost.
result_label: By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text.

TITLE: Connotation Lexicon: A Dash of Sentiment Beneath the Surface Meaning
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractUnderstanding the connotation of words plays an important role in interpreting subtle shades of sentiment beyond denotative or surface meaning of text, as seemingly objective statements often allude nuanced sentiment of the writer, and even purposefully conjure emotion from the readers' minds.
objective_label: The focus of this paper is drawing nuanced, connotative sentiments from even those words that are objective on the surface, such as "intelligence", "human", and "cheesecake".
method_label: We propose induction algorithms encoding a diverse set of linguistic insights (semantic prosody, distributional similarity, semantic parallelism of coordination) and prior knowledge drawn from lexical resources, resulting in the first broad-coverage connotation lexicon.

TITLE: A Microphotonic Astrocomb
ABSTRACT: background_label: One of the essential prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers.
background_label: It has already been realized that the large number of exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as calibration light sources.
background_label: A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers.
method_label: Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23.7 GHz.
method_label: This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer.
result_label: As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research.

TITLE: Extracting Contextual Evaluativity
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractRecent work on evaluativity or sentiment in the language sciences has focused on the contributions that lexical items provide.
background_label: In this paper, we discuss contextual evaluativity, stance that is inferred from lexical meaning and pragmatic environments.
method_label: Focusing on assessor-grounding claims like We liked him because he so clearly disliked Margaret Thatcher, we build a corpus and construct a system employing compositional principles of evaluativity calculation to derive that we dislikes Margaret Thatcher.
method_label: The resulting system has an F-score of 0.90 on our dataset, outperforming reasonable baselines, and indicating the viability of inferencing in the evaluative domain.
objective_label: Contextual EvaluativityA central aim of contemporary research on sentiment or evaluative language is the extraction of evaluative triples: evaluator, target, evaluation .
method_label: To date, both formal (e.g., Martin and White 2005, Potts 2005) and computational approaches (e.g., Pang and Lee 2008) have focused on how such triples are lexically encoded (e.g., the negative affect of scoundrel or dislike).
method_label: While lexical properties are a key source of evaluative information, word-based considerations alone can miss pragmatic inferences resulting from context.
result_label: (1), for example, communicates that the referent of we bears not only positive stance towards the referent of him, but also negative stance towards Margaret Thatcher:(1) We liked him because he so clearly disliked Margaret Thatcher.LEXICAL EVALUATIVITY: we, him, + ; he, M.T., -CONTEXTUAL EVALUATIVITY: we, M.T., -This paper argues for a compositional approach to contextual evaluativity similar to the compositional methods adopted for lexical evaluativity in Moilanen and Pulman (2007) and Nasukawa and Yi (2003) .
background_label: At the the heart of the approach is the treatment of verbal predicates (dislike in (1)) as evaluativity functors which relate argument/entity-level evaluativity to event-level evaluativity.
background_label: As discussed in §2, the utitlity of such a model surfaces in cases where the event-level evaluativity is known from context, and thus new information about the contextual evaluativity of the event participants (e.g.
background_label: Margaret Thatcher) can be inferred.
objective_label: Consequently, the empirical focus of this paper is on structures like (1), where the second clause provides grounds for the sentiment encoded in the first, and hence has a predictable event-level evaluation from the first clause's evaluator.
method_label: In §3 we describe the collection and annotation of a corpus of such assessment-grounding configurations from large-scale web data.
method_label: This annotated corpus serves as a test bed for experimental evaluation of various implementations of the proposed compositional approach.
result_label: The results of these experiments ( §4) strongly support a compositional approach to contextual evaluativity inference.
result_label: A simple compositional algorithm based on a small, manually created evaluativity functor lexicon demonstrated significantly better precision than non-compositional baselines.
result_label: Moreover, a method for automatically expanding coverage to novel predicates based on similarity with the manually created lexicon is shown to increase recall dramatically with modest reduction in precision.

TITLE: Recognizing Insufficiently Supported Arguments in Argumentative Essays
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we propose a new task for assessing the quality of natural language arguments.
background_label: The premises of a well-reasoned argument should provide enough evidence for accepting or rejecting its claim.
background_label: Although this criterion, known as sufficiency, is widely adopted in argumentation theory, there are no empirical studies on its applicability to real arguments.
method_label: In this work, we show that human annotators substantially agree on the sufficiency criterion and introduce a novel annotated corpus.
method_label: Furthermore, we experiment with feature-rich SVMs and convolutional neural networks and achieve 84% accuracy for automatically identifying insufficiently supported arguments.
result_label: The final corpus as well as the annotation guideline are freely available for encouraging future research on argument quality.

TITLE: Causal thinking and the representation of narrative events
ABSTRACT: background_label: The basis for representing narrative events in memory was investigated in reanalyses of the stories and data of R. C. Omanson (1982b, Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 21, 326–337) and N. L. Stein and C. G. Glenn (1979, In New Directions in Discourse Processing, Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum).
method_label: Causal network representations of the stories were derived for prediction of data on immediate and delayed recall, summarization, and judged importance of events.
method_label: Properties of the networks were compared in multiple regression analyses with other factors, notably the story-grammar categories of the events.
result_label: Whether or not an event was in a causal chain and the number of its causal connections were both found to account for substantial proportions of common and unique variance in all four measures.
result_label: The story-grammar category of events also contributed unique variance but overlapped substantially with the causal factors.
result_label: The concreteness, serial position, and argument overlap of an event failed to account uniquely for the data.
result_label: A recursive transition network model is discussed that integrates story grammar, causal chain, causal network, and hierarchical problem-solving approaches to story representation.

TITLE: Narrative research: a review of methodology and relevance to clinical practice.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Using qualitative narrative research to explore how people proceed through cancer diagnosis and treatment may help clinicians render better care and consequently enhance the probability of optimal health outcomes.
background_label: Narrative research can be defined as collecting and analyzing the accounts people tell to describe experiences and offer interpretation.
method_label: Often, oncology clinicians use narrative methods to investigate issues such as clinical outcomes, coping, and quality of life.
method_label: Narrative research provides an option to explore personal experiences beyond the boundaries of a questionnaire, providing insight into decisions involving treatment, screening or various health practices, which can help guide how health care services are developed and provided.
objective_label: The purpose of this article is to illustrate the use of narrative research methods to a clinical audience who may not be as familiar with narrative technique.
method_label: Definitions of narrative research, examples of published research using narrative methods in healthcare, validity and data analysis will be addressed.
result_label: A review of current literature from sociology, anthropology, nursing and psychology demonstrates that narrative methods are an effective research option that can lead to enhanced patient care.

TITLE: Coupling Story to Visualization: Using Textual Analysis as a Bridge Between Data and Interpretation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online writers and journalism media are increasingly combining visualization (and other multimedia content) with narrative text to create narrative visualizations.
background_label: Often, however, the two elements are presented independently of one another.
objective_label: We propose an approach to automatically integrate text and visualization elements.
objective_label: We begin with a writer's narrative that presumably can be supported with visual data evidence.
method_label: We leverage natural language processing, quantitative narrative analysis, and information visualization to (1) automatically extract narrative components (who, what, when, where) from data-rich stories, and (2) integrate the supporting data evidence with the text to develop a narrative visualization.
method_label: We also employ bidirectional interaction from text to visualization and visualization to text to support reader exploration in both directions.
result_label: We demonstrate the approach with a case study in the data-rich field of sports journalism.

TITLE: The PowerPoint Presentation and Its Corollaries: How Genres Shape Communicative Action in Organizations
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this chapter, we examine how and with what consequences the discursive expectations of the PowerPoint presentation genre shape the ongoing work of organizational actors.
method_label: We trace the historical development of the business presentation genre over the last century, examine the influence of the PowerPoint software tool, and consider the evolving enactment of the PowerPoint presentation genre in a few organizations.
method_label: Drawing on this analysis, we highlight the emergence of what we refer to as corollary genres that challenge our conventional understandings of genres as tightly coupled to particular recurrent situations and communicative purposes.
result_label: Our analysis points to an empirical blurring of genre expectations around conventional discursive practice, suggesting important implications for the nature of workplace communication in contemporary organizations.

TITLE: Learning Fine-Grained Knowledge about Contingent Relations between Everyday Events
ABSTRACT: background_label: Much of the user-generated content on social media is provided by ordinary people telling stories about their daily lives.
method_label: We develop and test a novel method for learning fine-grained common-sense knowledge from these stories about contingent (causal and conditional) relationships between everyday events.
method_label: This type of knowledge is useful for text and story understanding, information extraction, question answering, and text summarization.
method_label: We test and compare different methods for learning contingency relation, and compare what is learned from topic-sorted story collections vs. general-domain stories.
result_label: Our experiments show that using topic-specific datasets enables learning finer-grained knowledge about events and results in significant improvement over the baselines.
result_label: An evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows 82% of the relations between events that we learn from topic-sorted stories are judged as contingent.

TITLE: Malleability in communal goals and beliefs influences attraction to stem careers: evidence for a goal congruity perspective.
ABSTRACT: background_label: The goal congruity perspective posits that 2 distinct social cognitions predict attraction to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields.
background_label: First, individuals may particularly value communal goals (e.g., working with or helping others), due to either chronic individual differences or the salience of these goals in particular contexts.
background_label: Second, individuals hold beliefs about the activities that facilitate or impede these goals, or goal affordance stereotypes.
method_label: Women's tendency to endorse communal goals more highly than do men, along with consensual stereotypes that STEM careers impede communal goals, intersect to produce disinterest in STEM careers.
method_label: We provide evidence for the foundational predictions that gender differences emerge primarily on communal rather than agentic goals (Studies 1a and 3) and that goal affordance stereotypes reflect beliefs that STEM careers are relatively dissociated from communal goals (Studies 1b and 1c).
result_label: Most critically, we provide causal evidence that activated communal goals decrease interest in STEM fields (Study 2) and that the potential for a STEM career to afford communal goals elicits greater positivity (Study 3).
result_label: These studies thus provide a novel demonstration that understanding communal goals and goal affordance stereotypes can lend insight into attitudes toward STEM pursuits.

TITLE: An exploratory study of demographics, goals and expectations of private online language learners in Russia
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract There is a growing phenomenon of private online language tutoring worldwide, wherein learners hire language teachers via the Internet for one-to-one lessons.
background_label: Research has yet to examine private online language learners and their characteristics.
objective_label: This study explored whether there is a statistically significant relationship between these learners' demographic characteristics, stated learning goals, prior learning experience and learners' expectations of their future tutors.
method_label: In the study, statistical methods were used to analyse 121 application forms from one private online tutoring company in Russia.
result_label: Findings reveal that the majority of learners are adult learners, and hire private online tutors for work-related and examination-related reasons.
result_label: A significant correlation was found between learners' stated goals and their expectations of their future teachers.
result_label: Learners who were studying for an exam tended to use such adjectives as ‘strict’ and ‘demanding’ when describing their ‘ideal’ teachers, while learners studying for work-related purposes reported desiring a ‘result-providing’ instructor.
result_label: These findings were discussed in light of the self-determination theory and relevant studies on language learning motivation.

TITLE: DeepMind_Commentary
ABSTRACT: background_label: We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based reasoning is essential.
background_label: However, we favor an approach that centers on one additional ingredient: autonomy.
objective_label: In particular, we aim toward agents that can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human hand-engineering.
method_label: We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not available.
result_label: Here we survey several important examples of the progress that has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities, and highlight some outstanding challenges.

TITLE: Becoming a Nazi: A model for narrative networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract This article illustrates a strategy for representing and analyzing narratives as networks.
background_label: The strategy that we use considers narrative sequences as networks.
background_label: Elements are treated as nodes which are connected by narrative clauses, represented by arcs.
method_label: By representing complex event sequences as networks, inducing ‘narrative networks’, it is possible to observe and measure new structural features of narratives.
method_label: The narratives we focus on are autobiographical accounts of becoming, and being, a Nazi.
objective_label: The substantive idea that we develop in this article is that the observable narrative structure of life stories can provide insight into the process of identity formation.
result_label: We illustrate our approach to narrative networks by analyzing a single story that, in conjunction with the analysis of other stories, yields a set of insights into becoming and being .

TITLE: Abductive Commonsense Reasoning
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abductive reasoning is inference to the most plausible explanation.
background_label: For example, if Jenny finds her house in a mess when she returns from work, and remembers that she left a window open, she can hypothesize that a thief broke into her house and caused the mess, as the most plausible explanation.
background_label: While abduction has long been considered to be at the core of how people interpret and read between the lines in natural language (Hobbs et al.
background_label: (1988)), there has been relatively little NLP research in support of abductive natural language inference.
objective_label: We present the first study that investigates the viability of language-based abductive reasoning.
method_label: We conceptualize a new task of Abductive NLI and introduce a challenge dataset, ART, that consists of over 20k commonsense narrative contexts and 200k explanations, formulated as multiple choice questions for easy automatic evaluation.
method_label: We establish comprehensive baseline performance on this task based on state-of-the-art NLI and language models, which leads to 68.9% accuracy, well below human performance (91.4%).
result_label: Our analysis leads to new insights into the types of reasoning that deep pre-trained language models fail to perform -- despite their strong performance on the related but fundamentally different task of entailment NLI -- pointing to interesting avenues for future research.

TITLE: Conceptualising Religious Indifferences in Relation to Religion and Nonreligion
ABSTRACT: background_label: This introduction first, sketches the genesis of the notion ‘religious indifference’ from different theological debates.
background_label: Second, we illustrate its use in the social scientific debate on secularisation and modernity, highlighting some of the difficulties with defining and identifying indifferent populations.
method_label: On the base of a relational approach to nonreligion we further conceptualise religious indifference as lacking direct relationships with religion, but as positioned in relation to religious or more explicit nonreligious positions by relevant agents who render the lack of direct relationships to religion remarkable.
method_label: This perspective underscores the concepts’ entanglement with the scientific study of non/religion.
method_label: All this adds to conceptualising indifference as a symbolically powerful and contested concept.
result_label: We discuss ways of distinguishing between different forms of indifference and conclude this introduction by summarising the contributions to this volume.

TITLE: Crowd Work on a CV? Understanding How AMT Fits into Turkers' Career Goals and Professional Profiles
ABSTRACT: background_label: In 2013, scholars laid out a framework for a sustainable, ethical future of crowd work, recommending career ladders so that crowd work can lead to career advancement and more economic mobility.
background_label: Five years later, we consider this vision in the context of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).
method_label: To understand how workers currently view their experiences on AMT, and how they publicly present and share these experiences in their professional lives, we conducted a survey study with workers on AMT (n=98).
method_label: The survey we administered included a combination of multiple choice, binary, and open-ended (short paragraph) items gauging Turkers' perceptions of their experiences on AMT within the context of their broader work experience and career goals.
objective_label: This work extends existing understandings of who crowd workers are and why they crowd work by seeking to better understand how crowd work factors into Turkers' professional profiles, and how we can subsequently better support crowd workers in their career advancement.
result_label: Our survey results can inform the design of better tools to empower crowd workers in their professional development both inside and outside of AMT.

TITLE: Multimodal Frame Identification with Multilingual Evaluation
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractAn essential step in FrameNet Semantic Role Labeling is the Frame Identification (FrameId) task, which aims at disambiguating a situation around a predicate.
background_label: Whilst current FrameId methods rely on textual representations only, we hypothesize that FrameId can profit from a richer understanding of the situational context.
background_label: Such contextual information can be obtained from common sense knowledge, which is more present in images than in text.
objective_label: In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art FrameId system in order to effectively leverage multimodal representations.
method_label: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the English FrameNet and its German counterpart SALSA.
result_label: Our analysis shows that for the German data, textual representations are still competitive with multimodal ones.
result_label: However on the English data, our multimodal FrameId approach outperforms its unimodal counterpart, setting a new state of the art.
result_label: Its benefits are particularly apparent in dealing with ambiguous and rare instances, the main source of errors of current systems.
result_label: For research purposes, we release (a) the implementation of our system, (b) our evaluation splits for SALSA 2.0, and (c) the embeddings for synsets and IMAGINED words.

ABSTRACT: background_label: In everyday communicative arenas, we engage in critical discussions to persuade others to change their views about issues of personal as well as public interest.
background_label: Discourse analysts have deemed concessions as privileged strategies to manage disagreement and reach consensus.
background_label: However, a coherent and comprehensive account of the argumentative functions played by different concessive relations is lacking: do concessions always bear an argumentative role?
background_label: By which semantic and pragmatic properties?
background_label: What type of argumentative moves do they instantiate?
objective_label: To answer these questions, we propose a corpus-based study of lexical markers of concessions in the subreddit Changemyview.
method_label: Drawing from a multilevel semantic and pragmatic annotation, polysemous markers with contrast are disambiguated, and an empirically motivated typology of concessive relations is proposed.
result_label: The results of the analysis highlight two types of concessions that are specialized in introducing and/or preventing counterarguments.

TITLE: Reconceptualising Personas Across Cultures: Archetypes, Stereotypes & Collective Personas in Pastoral Namibia
ABSTRACT: other_label: Abstract.
background_label: The paucity of projects where persona is the research foci and a lack of consensus on this artefact keep many reticent about its purpose and value.
background_label: Besides crafting personas is expected to differ across cultures, which contrasts the advancements in Western theory with studies and progress in other sites.
method_label: We postulate User-Created Personas reveal specific characteristics of situated contexts by allowing laypeople to design persona artefacts in their own terms.
method_label: Hence analysing four persona sessions with an ethnic group in pastoral Namibia -ovaHerero-brought up a set of fundamental questions around the persona artefact regarding stereotypes, archetypes, and collective persona representations: (1) to what extent user depictions are stereotypical or archetypal?
result_label: If stereotypes prime (2) to what degree are current personas a useful method to represent endusers in technology design?
result_label: And, (3) how can we ultimately read accounts not conforming to mainstream individual persona descriptions but to collectives?

TITLE: Applying planning to interactive storytelling: Narrative control using state constraints
ABSTRACT: background_label: We have seen ten years of the application of AI planning to the problem of narrative generation in Interactive Storytelling (IS).
background_label: In that time planning has emerged as the dominant technology and has featured in a number of prototype systems.
background_label: Nevertheless key issues remain, such as how best to control the shape of the narrative that is generated (e.g., by using narrative control knowledge, i.e., knowledge about narrative features that enhance user experience) and also how best to provide support for real-time interactive performance in order to scale up to more realistic sized systems.
objective_label: Recent progress in planning technology has opened up new avenues for IS and we have developed a novel approach to narrative generation that builds on this.
method_label: Our approach is to specify narrative control knowledge for a given story world using state trajectory constraints and then to treat these state constraints as landmarks and to use them to decompose narrative generation in order to address scalability issues and the goal of real-time performance in larger story domains.
method_label: This approach to narrative generation is fully implemented in an interactive narrative based on the “Merchant of Venice.” The contribution of the work lies both in our novel use of state constraints to specify narrative control knowledge for interactive storytelling and also our development of an approach to narrative generation that exploits such constraints.
result_label: In the article we show how the use of state constraints can provide a unified perspective on important problems faced in IS.

TITLE: Is reflexivity the key to minimising problems of interpretation in phenomenological research?
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AIM To discuss and demonstrate the use of reflexivity in interpretive phenomenological analysis.
objective_label: BACKGROUND Interpretative phenomenological analysis focuses on understanding individual experiences through interpretation.
background_label: A double hermeneutic is created as the researcher makes sense of participants' experiences.
background_label: It is crucial to undergo a process of reflexivity to provide a credible and plausible explanation of participants' accounts and avoid assumptions.
method_label: DATA SOURCES Research undertaken with six sub-Saharan African healthcare professionals.
result_label: REVIEW METHODS Articles were selected from Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Medline and Google Scholar.
background_label: Searches were based on relevance and with priority to those dated over the past five years.
background_label: DISCUSSION This article has reviewed pertinent literature and personal examples of reflexivity in research practice to aid nurse researcher understanding and encourage its use, particularly when employing interpretative methodologies.
background_label: CONCLUSION Reflexivity is an active process that may, at times, be difficult and probing, but which is crucial to becoming self-aware and thus able to see any influences that could affect data collection or analysis.
method_label: This process will increase understanding and allow for a more rigorous approach.
method_label: IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Many practical examples are offered for using reflexivity.
result_label: Nurse researchers may choose one or a mixture of the options offered, such as use of time and space to distance themselves from their research, aspects of practical self-presentation, or a reflexive diary.

TITLE: Joint modelling of goals and bookings in association football
ABSTRACT: background_label: type="main" xml:id="rssa12075-abs-0001"> A multivariate counting process formulation is developed for the quantification of association football event interdependences which permits dynamic prediction as events unfold.
method_label: We model data from English Premier League and Championship games from the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 football seasons and assess predictive capacity by using a model-based betting strategy, applied prospectively to available live spread betting prices.
method_label: Both the scoreline and the bookings status were predictive of match outcome.
result_label: In particular, the award of a red card led to increased goal rates for the non-penalized team and the home team scoring rate decreased once they were ahead.
result_label: Overall the betting strategy profited with gains made in the bookings markets.

TITLE: Plagiarisms, Authorships, and the Academic Death Penalty.
ABSTRACT: background_label: n composition studies, most published discussions of student plagiarism proceed from the assumption that plagiarism occurs as a result of one of two possible motivations: an absence of ethics or an ignorance of citation conventions.
background_label: Some students don't appreciate academic textual values and therefore deliberately submit work that is not their own; others don't understand academic citation conventions and therefore plagiarize inadvertently.
background_label: Both of these are negative interpretations, postulating an absence-of either ethics or knowledge-in the plagiarist.
background_label: A few recent studies, though, identify positive motivations for patchwriting, a textual strategy that has traditionally been classified as plagiarism.
background_label: Patchwriting involves "copying from a source text and then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-for-one synonym-substitutes" (Howard 233).
background_label: Describing the textual strategies of Tanya, a student who in traditional pedagogy might be labeled "remedial," Glynda Hull and Mike Rose celebrate her patchwriting as a valuable stage toward becoming an authoritative academic writer: "we depend upon membership in a community for our language, our voices, our very arguments.
background_label: We forget that we, like Tanya, continually appropriate each other's language to establish group membership, to grow, and to define ourselves in new ways, and that such appropriation is a fundamental part of language use, even as the appearance of our texts belies it" (152).
method_label: These and other studies describe patchwriting as a pedagogical opportunity, not a juridical problem.
result_label: They recommend that teachers treat it as an important transitional strategy in the student's progress toward membership in a discourse community.
other_label: To treat it negatively, as a "problem" to be "cured" or punished, would

TITLE: The role of need for closure in essentialist entitativity beliefs and prejudice: an epistemic needs approach to racial categorization.
ABSTRACT: background_label: The present research investigates how people's general epistemic motives may inspire essentialist beliefs about racial groups and racism.
objective_label: In three studies, we focus particularly on essentialist entitativity (EE, referring to beliefs about the uniformity, informativeness, and inherent core of racial groups), probing into its relationships with epistemic need for closure (NFC) and prejudice.
method_label: In Study 1, we develop an EE scale, empirically distinguish it from the naturalness component of essentialism and non-EE beliefs, and establish its predictive utility for explaining racial prejudice.
method_label: Study 2 provides experimental evidence for the causal effect of NFC on EE beliefs.
result_label: Study 3 demonstrates in three different samples that EE beliefs mediate the relationship between dispositional NFC and racial prejudice.
result_label: It is argued that EE beliefs about racial groups are an expression of motivated social cognition, serving people's seizing needs for quick and easy social judgment.

TITLE: Controversy in Context
ABSTRACT: background_label: With the growing interest in social applications of Natural Language Processing and Computational Argumentation, a natural question is how controversial a given concept is.
background_label: Prior works relied on Wikipedia's metadata and on content analysis of the articles pertaining to a concept in question.
method_label: Here we show that the immediate textual context of a concept is strongly indicative of this property, and, using simple and language-independent machine-learning tools, we leverage this observation to achieve state-of-the-art results in controversiality prediction.
method_label: In addition, we analyze and make available a new dataset of concepts labeled for controversiality.
result_label: It is significantly larger than existing datasets, and grades concepts on a 0-10 scale, rather than treating controversiality as a binary label.

TITLE: Aligning Predicate Argument Structures in Monolingual Comparable Texts: A New Corpus for a New Task
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractDiscourse coherence is an important aspect of natural language that is still understudied in computational linguistics.
objective_label: Our aim is to learn factors that constitute coherent discourse from data, with a focus on how to realize predicateargument structures (PAS) in a model that exceeds the sentence level.
objective_label: In particular, we aim to study the case of non-realized arguments as a coherence inducing factor.
method_label: This task can be broken down into two subtasks.
method_label: The first aligns predicates across comparable texts, admitting partial argument structure correspondence.
method_label: The resulting alignments and their contexts can then be used for developing a coherence model for argument realization.
method_label: This paper introduces a large corpus of comparable monolingual texts as a prerequisite for approaching this task, including an evaluation set with manual predicate alignments.
result_label: We illustrate the potential of this new resource for the empirical investigation of discourse coherence phenomena.
result_label: Initial experiments on the task of predicting predicate alignments across text pairs show promising results.
result_label: Our findings establish that manual and automatic predicate alignments across texts are feasible and that our data set holds potential for empirical research into a variety of discourse-related tasks.

TITLE: The origins of narrative: In search of the transactional format of narratives in humans and other social animals
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This article presents work in progress towards a better understanding of the origins of narrative.
objective_label: Assuming an evolutionary and developmental continuity of mental experiences, we propose a grounding of human narrative capacities in non-verbal narrative transactions in non-human animals, and in pre-verbal narrative transactions of human children.
method_label: We discuss narrative intelligence in the context of the evolution of primate (social) intelligence, and with respect to the particular cognitive limits that constrain the development of human social networks and societies.
method_label: We explain the Narrative Intelligence Hypothesis which suggests that the evolutionary origin of communicating in a narrative format co-evolved with increasingly complex social dynamics among our human ancestors.
method_label: This article gives examples of social interactions in non-human primates and how these can be interpreted in terms of narrative formats.
result_label: Due to the central role of narrative in human communication and social interaction, we discuss how research into the origins of narrative can impact the development of humane technology which is designed to meet the biological, cognitive and social needs of human story-tellers.

TITLE: Socratrees: Make Discussions Great Again
ABSTRACT: background_label: Terms like 'misinformation', 'fake news', and 'echo chambers' permeate current discussions on the state of the Internet.
background_label: We believe a lack of technological support to evaluate, contest, and reason about information online---as opposed to merely disseminating it---lies at the root of these problems.
background_label: Several argument technologies support such functionality, but have seen limited use outside of niche communities.
background_label: Most research systems overemphasize argument analysis, standing in stark contrast with the informal dialectical nature of everyday argumentation.
background_label: Conversely, non-academic systems overlook important implications for design which can be derived from theory.
objective_label: In this paper, we present the design of a system aiming to strike a balance between the two.
method_label: Informatron is a website for collaborative argumentative discussion targeting layman users, but includes sophisticated community guidelines and novel features inspired by informal logic; we argue these are key to scaling up argumentation.
result_label: Based on a six-week-long evaluation and subsequent survey sent out to all active users, we conclude that while contributing to arguments remains a complex task, most users learned to do so effectively with minimal guidance and all recognized that structure improves online discussion and results in a clearer overview of arguments.

TITLE: HappyDB: A Corpus of 100,000 Crowdsourced Happy Moments
ABSTRACT: background_label: The science of happiness is an area of positive psychology concerned with understanding what behaviors make people happy in a sustainable fashion.
background_label: Recently, there has been interest in developing technologies that help incorporate the findings of the science of happiness into users' daily lives by steering them towards behaviors that increase happiness.
method_label: With the goal of building technology that can understand how people express their happy moments in text, we crowd-sourced HappyDB, a corpus of 100,000 happy moments that we make publicly available.
method_label: This paper describes HappyDB and its properties, and outlines several important NLP problems that can be studied with the help of the corpus.
method_label: We also apply several state-of-the-art analysis techniques to analyze HappyDB.
result_label: Our results demonstrate the need for deeper NLP techniques to be developed which makes HappyDB an exciting resource for follow-on research.

TITLE: Hand detection in First Person Vision
ABSTRACT: background_label: The emergence of new pervasive wearable technologies (e.g.
background_label: action cameras and smart glasses) calls attention to the so called First Person Vision (FPV).
background_label: In the future, more and more everyday-life videos will be shot from a first-person point of view, overturning the classical fixed-camera understanding of Vision, specializing the existing knowledge of moving cameras and bringing new challenges in the field of video processing.
objective_label: The trend in research is going to be oriented towards a new type of computer vision, centred on moving sensors and driven by the need for new applications for wearable devices.
method_label: We identify hand tracking and gesture recognition as an essential topic in this field, motivated by the simple realization that we often look at our hand, even while performing the simplest tasks in everyday life.
method_label: In addition, the next frontier in user interfaces are hands-free devices.
objective_label: In this work we argue that applications based on FPV may involve information fusion at various complexity and abstraction levels, ranging from pure image processing to inference over patterns.
result_label: We address the lowest, by proposing a first investigation on hand detection from a first-person point of view sensor and some preliminary results obtained fusing colour and optic flow information.

TITLE: A Study on the Use of Eye Tracking to Adapt Gameplay and Procedural Content Generation in First-Person Shooter Games
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper studies the use of eye tracking in a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game as a~mechanism to: (1) control the attention of the player's avatar according to the attention deployed by the player, and (2) guide the gameplay and game's procedural content generation, accordingly.
method_label: This results in a more natural use of eye tracking in comparison to a use in which the eye tracker directly substitutes control input devices, such as gamepads.
method_label: The study was conducted on a custom endless runner FPS, Zombie Runner, using an affordable eye tracker.
result_label: Evaluation sessions showed that the proposed use of eye tracking provides a more challenging and immersive experience to the player, when compared to its absence.
result_label: However, a strong correlation between eye tracker calibration problems and player's overall experience was found.
result_label: This means that eye tracking technology still needs to evolve but also means that once technology gets mature enough players are expected to benefit greatly from the inclusion of eye tracking in their gaming experience.

TITLE: Skip-Thought Vectors
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe an approach for unsupervised learning of a generic, distributed sentence encoder.
method_label: Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage.
method_label: Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations.
method_label: We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words.
method_label: After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets.
result_label: The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice.
result_label: We will make our encoder publicly available.

TITLE: Modeling Trolling in Social Media Conversations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social media websites, electronic newspapers and Internet forums allow visitors to leave comments for others to read and interact.
background_label: This exchange is not free from participants with malicious intentions, who troll others by positing messages that are intended to be provocative, offensive, or menacing.
method_label: With the goal of facilitating the computational modeling of trolling, we propose a trolling categorization that is novel in the sense that it allows comment-based analysis from both the trolls' and the responders' perspectives, characterizing these two perspectives using four aspects, namely, the troll's intention and his intention disclosure, as well as the responder's interpretation of the troll's intention and her response strategy.
method_label: Using this categorization, we annotate and release a dataset containing excerpts of Reddit conversations involving suspected trolls and their interactions with other users.
result_label: Finally, we identify the difficult-to-classify cases in our corpus and suggest potential solutions for them.

TITLE: The influence of implicit and explicit biofeedback in first-person shooter games
ABSTRACT: background_label: To understand how implicit and explicit biofeedback work in games, we developed a first-person shooter (FPS) game to experiment with different biofeedback techniques.
background_label: While this area has seen plenty of discussion, there is little rigorous experimentation addressing how biofeedback can enhance human-computer interaction.
method_label: In our two-part study, (N=36) subjects first played eight different game stages with two implicit biofeedback conditions, with two simulation-based comparison and repetition rounds, then repeated the two biofeedback stages when given explicit information on the biofeedback.
method_label: The biofeedback conditions were respiration and skin-conductance (EDA) adaptations.
method_label: Adaptation targets were four balanced player avatar attributes.
method_label: We collected data with psycho¬physiological measures (electromyography, respiration, and EDA), a game experience questionnaire, and game-play measures.
result_label: According to our experiment, implicit biofeedback does not produce significant effects in player experience in an FPS game.
result_label: In the explicit biofeedback conditions, players were more immersed and positively affected, and they were able to manipulate the game play with the biosignal interface.
result_label: We recommend exploring the possibilities of using explicit biofeedback interaction in commercial games.

TITLE: Fostering User Engagement: Rhetorical Devices for Applause Generation Learnt from TED Talks
ABSTRACT: background_label: One problem that every presenter faces when delivering a public discourse is how to hold the listeners' attentions or to keep them involved.
background_label: Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause.
method_label: To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation.
method_label: Through conducting regression anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of audience applauding.
result_label: We further build models that can rec-ognize applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.

TITLE: Tense and Aspect Assignment in Narrative Discourse
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe describe a method for assigning English tense and aspect in a system that realizes surface text for symbolically encoded narratives.
method_label: Our testbed is an encoding interface in which propositions that are attached to a timeline must be realized from several temporal viewpoints.
method_label: This involves a mapping from a semantic encoding of time to a set of tense/aspect permutations.
method_label: The encoding tool realizes each permutation to give a readable, precise description of the narrative so that users can check whether they have correctly encoded actions and statives in the formal representation.
method_label: Our method selects tenses and aspects for individual event intervals as well as subintervals (with multiple reference points), quoted and unquoted speech (which reassign the temporal focus), and modal events such as conditionals.

TITLE: Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality
ABSTRACT: background_label: The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships.
method_label: In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed.
method_label: By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations.
method_label: We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.
method_label: An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.
method_label: For example, the meanings of"Canada"and"Air"cannot be easily combined to obtain"Air Canada".
result_label: Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.

TITLE: Joint Person Segmentation and Identification in Synchronized First- and Third-person Videos
ABSTRACT: background_label: In a world of pervasive cameras, public spaces are often captured from multiple perspectives by cameras of different types, both fixed and mobile.
background_label: An important problem is to organize these heterogeneous collections of videos by finding connections between them, such as identifying correspondences between the people appearing in the videos and the people holding or wearing the cameras.
method_label: In this paper, we wish to solve two specific problems: (1) given two or more synchronized third-person videos of a scene, produce a pixel-level segmentation of each visible person and identify corresponding people across different views (i.e., determine who in camera A corresponds with whom in camera B), and (2) given one or more synchronized third-person videos as well as a first-person video taken by a mobile or wearable camera, segment and identify the camera wearer in the third-person videos.
method_label: Unlike previous work which requires ground truth bounding boxes to estimate the correspondences, we perform person segmentation and identification jointly.
result_label: We find that solving these two problems simultaneously is mutually beneficial, because better fine-grained segmentation allows us to better perform matching across views, and information from multiple views helps us perform more accurate segmentation.
result_label: We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets of interacting people captured from multiple wearable cameras, and show that our proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art on both person segmentation and identification.

TITLE: Characterizing embodied interaction in First and Third Person Perspective viewpoints
ABSTRACT: background_label: Third Person Perspective (3PP) viewpoints have the potential to expand how one perceives and acts in a virtual environment.
background_label: They offer increased awareness of the posture and of the surrounding of the virtual body as compared to First Person Perspective (1PP).
background_label: But from another standpoint, 3PP can be considered as less effective for inducing a strong sense of embodiment into a virtual body.
objective_label: Following an experimental paradigm based on full body motion capture and immersive interaction, this study investigates the effect of perspective and of visuomotor synchrony on the sense of embodiment.
result_label: It provides evidence supporting a high sense of embodiment in both 1PP and 3PP during engaging motor tasks, as well as guidelines for choosing the optimal perspective depending on location of targets.

TITLE: Future Person Localization in First-Person Videos
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We present a new task that predicts future locations of people observed in first-person videos.
background_label: Consider a first-person video stream continuously recorded by a wearable camera.
objective_label: Given a short clip of a person that is extracted from the complete stream, we aim to predict that person's location in future frames.
method_label: To facilitate this future person localization ability, we make the following three key observations: a) First-person videos typically involve significant ego-motion which greatly affects the location of the target person in future frames; b) Scales of the target person act as a salient cue to estimate a perspective effect in first-person videos; c) First-person videos often capture people up-close, making it easier to leverage target poses (e.g., where they look) for predicting their future locations.
method_label: We incorporate these three observations into a prediction framework with a multi-stream convolution-deconvolution architecture.
result_label: Experimental results reveal our method to be effective on our new dataset as well as on a public social interaction dataset.

TITLE: Annotation of Linguistic and Conceptual Metaphor
ABSTRACT: background_label: Metaphor makes our thoughts more vivid and fills our communication with richer imagery.
background_label: Furthermore, according to the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) of [30], metaphor also plays an important structural role in the organization and processing of conceptual knowledge.
background_label: According to this account, the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to similarity-based extensions of meanings of individual words, but instead involves activating fixed mappings that reconceptualize one whole area of experience in terms of another.
background_label: CMT produced a significant resonance in the fields of philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence and still underlies a large proportion of modern research on metaphor.
background_label: However, there has to date been no comprehensive corpus-based study of conceptual metaphor, which would provide an empirical basis for evaluating the CMT using real-world linguistic data.
objective_label: The annotation scheme and the empirical study we present in this chapter is a step towards filling this gap.
objective_label: We test our annotation procedure in an experimental setting involving multiple annotators and estimate their agreement on the task.
method_label: The goal of the study is to investigate (1) how intuitive the conceptual metaphor explanation of linguistic metaphors is for human annotators and whether it is possible to consistently annotate interconceptual mappings; (2) what are the main difficulties that the annotators experience during the annotation process; (3) whether one conceptual metaphor is sufficient to explain a linguistic metaphor or whether a chain of conceptual metaphors is needed.
result_label: The resulting corpus annotated for conceptual mappings provides a new, valuable dataset for linguistic, computational and cognitive experiments on metaphor.

TITLE: A Visualizable Evidence-Driven Approach for Authorship Attribution
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Internet provides an ideal anonymous channel for concealing computer-mediated malicious activities, as the network-based origins of critical electronic textual evidence (e.g., emails, blogs, forum posts, chat logs, etc.)
background_label: can be easily repudiated.
background_label: Authorship attribution is the study of identifying the actual author of the given anonymous documents based on the text itself, and for decades, many linguistic stylometry and computational techniques have been extensively studied for this purpose.
background_label: However, most of the previous research emphasizes promoting the authorship attribution accuracy, and few works have been done for the purpose of constructing and visualizing the evidential traits.
background_label: In addition, these sophisticated techniques are difficult for cyber investigators or linguistic experts to interpret.
objective_label: In this article, based on the End-to-End Digital Investigation (EEDI) framework, we propose a visualizable evidence-driven approach, namely VEA, which aims at facilitating the work of cyber investigation.
result_label: Our comprehensive controlled experiment and the stratified experiment on the real-life Enron email dataset demonstrate that our approach can achieve even higher accuracy than traditional methods; meanwhile, its output can be easily visualized and interpreted as evidential traits.
result_label: In addition to identifying the most plausible author of a given text, our approach also estimates the confidence for the predicted result based on a given identification context and presents visualizable linguistic evidence for each candidate.

TITLE: Goals in conflict: semantic foundations of goals in agent programming
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper addresses the notion of (declarative) goals as used in agent programming.
background_label: Goals describe desirable states, and semantics of these goals in an agent programming context can be defined in various ways.
objective_label: We focus in this paper on the representation of conflicting goals.
method_label: In particular, we define two semantics for goals, one for unconditional goals and one for conditional goals.
method_label: The first is based on propositional logic, and the latter is based on default logic.
result_label: We establish relations between and properties of these semantics.

TITLE: Simple English Wikipedia: A New Text Simplification Task
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractIn this paper we examine the task of sentence simplification which aims to reduce the reading complexity of a sentence by incorporating more accessible vocabulary and sentence structure.
method_label: We introduce a new data set that pairs English Wikipedia with Simple English Wikipedia and is orders of magnitude larger than any previously examined for sentence simplification.
method_label: The data contains the full range of simplification operations including rewording, reordering, insertion and deletion.
result_label: We provide an analysis of this corpus as well as preliminary results using a phrase-based translation approach for simplification.

TITLE: Evaluating automatically generated location-based stories for tourists
ABSTRACT: background_label: Tourism provides over six percent of the world's gross domestic product.
background_label: As a result, there have been many efforts to use technology to improve the tourist's experience via mobile tour guide systems.
background_label: One key bottleneck in such location-based systems is content development; existing systems either provide trivial information at a global scale or present quality narratives but at an extremely local scale.
background_label: The primary reason for this dichotomy is that, although good narrative content is more educationally effective (and more entertaining) than a stream of simple, disconnected facts, it is time-intensive and expensive to develop.
method_label: However, the WikEar system uses narrative theory-informed data mining methodologies in an effort to produce high-quality narrative content for any location on Earth.
method_label: It allows tourists to interact with these narratives using their camera-enabled cell phones and an innovative interface designed around a magic lens and paper map metaphor.
result_label: In this paper, we describe a first evaluation of these narratives and the WikEar interface, which reported promising, but not conclusive, results.
result_label: We also present ideas for future work that will use this feedback to improve the narratives.

TITLE: First-Person Vision
ABSTRACT: background_label: For understanding the behavior, intent, and environment of a person, the surveillance metaphor is traditional; that is, install cameras and observe the subject, and his/her interaction with other people and the environment.
background_label: Instead, we argue that the first-person vision (FPV), which senses the environment and the subject's activities from a wearable sensor, is more advantageous with images about the subject's environment as taken from his/her view points, and with readily available information about head motion and gaze through eye tracking.
result_label: In this paper, we review key research challenges that need to be addressed to develop such FPV systems, and describe our ongoing work to address them using examples from our prototype systems.

TITLE: Stand up and take your place: identifying narrative elements in narrative adventure and role-play games
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article reports results from a series of empirical studies exploring narrative dimensions of adventure and role-play in computer-game design.
method_label: It identifies aspects of narrative employed in such games, considers the significance of narrative structures and devices in increasing user-engagement, and reflects on game-design implications.Because not all approaches identified in traditional narrative theory can be applied to the new, interactive media, a phenomenological, reader-response methodology was used in the studies to identify narrative considerations appropriate to game-players' experiences.
method_label: In two model focus-group studies, evaluative responses to games played in a controlled environment were analyzed.
method_label: From the factors identified as affecting engagement, those with narrative aspects were isolated and their significance assessed.
method_label: Among the factors identified are characterization, identification, agency, motivation, plot, linearity, and authorial control.
result_label: Also considered is the disruption of primal narrative features of narrative--causality, temporality, and linearity--within a hyper-structure, and a number of design techniques and strategies to resolve such tensions and promote user engagement are suggested.

TITLE: Exploring the Availability of Student Scientist Identities within Curriculum Discourse: an anti-essentialist approach to gender inclusive science
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article takes an anti-essentialist approach to the gendered construction of the science curriculum and its exclusivity.
background_label: Drawing on post-structuralist theory, it examines the student subject positions that are generated within the dominant discourses and practices of curriculum science.
method_label: A critical discourse analysis of student interview talk demonstrates the importance of both gender and ethnicity in the production of, or rejection of, scientist identities.
background_label: While hegemonic masculinity can provide comfortable scientist identities for some males, femininity is less compatible with physical scientist subjectivities, although the 'otherness' of ethnicity can provide exceptions to this.
result_label: Meanwhile, constructivist discourses of science, more often associated with biology, offer the possibility of a wider range of student scientist identities that transcend masculine/feminine dualisms.
result_label: This approach to gender and science not only explains why physical science remains the preserve of a largely male elite witho...

TITLE: Analysis of Speeches in Indian Parliamentary Debates
ABSTRACT: background_label: With the increasing usage of the internet, more and more data is being digitized including parliamentary debates but they are in an unstructured format.
background_label: There is a need to convert them into a structured format for linguistic analysis.
background_label: Much work has been done on parliamentary data such as Hansard, American congressional floor-debate data on various aspects but less on pragmatics.
method_label: In this paper, we provide a dataset for the synopsis of Indian parliamentary debates and perform stance classification of speeches i.e identifying if the speaker is supporting the bill/issue or against it.
method_label: We also analyze the intention of the speeches beyond mere sentences i.e pragmatics in the parliament.
method_label: Based on thorough manual analysis of the debates, we developed an annotation scheme of 4 mutually exclusive categories to analyze the purpose of the speeches: to find out ISSUES, to BLAME, to APPRECIATE and for CALL FOR ACTION.
method_label: We have annotated the dataset provided, with these 4 categories and conducted preliminary experiments for automatic detection of the categories.
result_label: Our automated classification approach gave us promising results.

TITLE: Navigating Social Roles in Pursuit of Important Goals: A Communal Goal Congruity Account of STEM Pursuits
ABSTRACT: background_label: Our exploration of communal goal processes in decisions about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers integrates research on goal pursuit processes with research on stereotyping and on social role occupancy.
background_label: Social roles encompass expectations and resources that can originate from group membership in broad social categories, such as gender, ethnicity, or nationality, or from more narrowly focused occupational and family roles.
objective_label: Our review elaborates on three ways in which social roles intersect with goal pursuit processes, with particular attention to how communal goals influence STEM pursuits.
method_label: First, social roles influence goal selection or what goals are prioritized generally and at a particular time.
method_label: Second, beliefs about social roles can influence the kinds of roles that people shy away from or seek out.
method_label: Third, occupying a particular social role can actually facilitate or impede goal progress.
result_label: With regard to STEM pursuits, we demonstrate that communal goals are valued both generally by people and especially by women, and that consensual stereotypes describe STEM fields as less likely to afford communal goals than other occupational roles.
result_label: However, emphasizing the communal aspects of STEM fields elicits greater positivity toward these roles.
result_label: Finally, we explore the ways in which STEM occupational roles are or might be enacted in communally-oriented ways.
result_label: The goal congruity perspective thus can offer a unifying framework to integrate an understanding of the social structure – that is, roles and contexts – with the social cognition of the individual – that is, critical motivational and cognitive processes.

TITLE: Visual narrative structure.
ABSTRACT: background_label: Narratives are an integral part of human expression.
background_label: In the graphic form, they range from cave paintings to Egyptian hieroglyphics, from the Bayeux Tapestry to modern day comic books (Kunzle, 1973; McCloud, 1993).
background_label: Yet not much research has addressed the structure and comprehension of narrative images, for example, how do people create meaning out of sequential images?
objective_label: This piece helps fill the gap by presenting a theory of Narrative Grammar.
method_label: We describe the basic narrative categories and their relationship to a canonical narrative arc, followed by a discussion of complex structures that extend beyond the canonical schema.
method_label: This demands that the canonical arc be reconsidered as a generative schema whereby any narrative category can be expanded into a node in a tree structure.
method_label: Narrative "pacing" is interpreted as a reflection of various patterns of this embedding: conjunction, left-branching trees, center-embedded constituencies, and others.
method_label: Following this, diagnostic methods are proposed for testing narrative categories and constituency.
result_label: Finally, we outline the applicability of this theory beyond sequential images, such as to film and verbal discourse, and compare this theory with previous approaches to narrative and discourse.

TITLE: #babyfever: Social and media influences on fertility desires
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract The current work involves an analysis of the content of 499 tweets containing the hashtag “#babyfever” to investigate predicted relationships between certain individual differences (e.g., sex, relationship status), environmental factors (e.g., exposure to children) and the sharing of “baby fever” experiences.
result_label: Our sample was almost exclusively female (95%), mostly White (67.5%; 16.2% African American, 9.0% Hispanic), and mostly childless (87%) with an average age of 20.52 (SDage = 2.21).
result_label: As predicted, the majority of shared experiences of “baby fever” included positive emotional responses, and were associated with the users’ direct exposure to a baby in their life.
result_label: Positive mentions of “baby fever” were more likely to include mentions of direct exposure to babies.
result_label: Negative mentions of “baby fever” were associated with perceptions that most of an individual’s peer group seems to be having babies and were more common amongst tweeters who were not in committed relationships.

TITLE: Incorporating Structured Commonsense Knowledge in Story Completion
ABSTRACT: background_label: The ability to select an appropriate story ending is the first step towards perfect narrative comprehension.
background_label: Story ending prediction requires not only the explicit clues within the context, but also the implicit knowledge (such as commonsense) to construct a reasonable and consistent story.
background_label: However, most previous approaches do not explicitly use background commonsense knowledge.
method_label: We present a neural story ending selection model that integrates three types of information: narrative sequence, sentiment evolution and commonsense knowledge.
result_label: Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a public dataset, ROCStory Cloze Task , and the performance gain from adding the additional commonsense knowledge is significant.

TITLE: Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractSemantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way.
background_label: Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition.
objective_label: To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank.
method_label: It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality.
method_label: To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network.
method_label: When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics.
method_label: It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%.
result_label: The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines.
result_label: Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.

TITLE: Bivariate Agreement Coefficients for Reliability of Data
ABSTRACT: background_label: The quality of data in content analysis, in surveys with openended questions, in the observation of unstructured social events, and so on, critically depends on the reliability with which primary observations are assigned to categories, scaled, or measured.
background_label: To help assure valid interpretations, agreement between two independent observers is measured.
background_label: When agreement is due merely to chance, data may have little to do with the phenomena studied.
background_label: In order for such data to be empirically meaningful, a high degree of inter-observer agreement must be demonstrated.
objective_label: This paper suggests that several heretofore unrelated bivariate agreement coefficients may in fact be regarded as belonging to one family.
method_label: It presents a paradigm through which their formal resemblances become transparent and it proposes efficient formulas for their computation.

TITLE: Pursuing Attainment versus Maintenance Goals: The Interplay of Self-Construal and Goal Type on Consumer Motivation
ABSTRACT: background_label: This research examines how self-construal (i.e., independent vs. interdependent) and goal type (i.e., attainment vs. maintenance) are conceptually linked and jointly impact consumer behavior.
result_label: The results of five experiments and one field study involving different operationalizations of self-construal and goal pursuit activities suggest that attainment (maintenance) goals can be more motivating for participants with a more independent (interdependent) self-construal and that differences in salient knowledge about pursuing the goals are one potential mechanism underlying this effect.
method_label: This interaction effect was found within a single culture, between cultures, when self-construal was experimentally manipulated or measured, and when potential confounding factors like regulatory focus were controlled for.
result_label: The effect was also found to impact consumer behavior in real life—self-construal, as reflected by the number of social ties consumers had, impacted the likelihood that they opted to reduce versus maintain their bodyweight.
result_label: Further, after setting their goal, consumers who were more independent exhibited more (less) motivation, as measured by the amount of money they put at stake, when their goal was weight reduction (maintenance).
result_label: These findings shed light on the relationship between self-construal and goal type, and offer insights, to both consumers and managers, on how to increase motivation for goal pursuit.

TITLE: Listening between the Lines: Learning Personal Attributes from Conversations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Open-domain dialogue agents must be able to converse about many topics while incorporating knowledge about the user into the conversation.
objective_label: In this work we address the acquisition of such knowledge, for personalization in downstream Web applications, by extracting personal attributes from conversations.
background_label: This problem is more challenging than the established task of information extraction from scientific publications or Wikipedia articles, because dialogues often give merely implicit cues about the speaker.
method_label: We propose methods for inferring personal attributes, such as profession, age or family status, from conversations using deep learning.
method_label: Specifically, we propose several Hidden Attribute Models, which are neural networks leveraging attention mechanisms and embeddings.
method_label: Our methods are trained on a per-predicate basis to output rankings of object values for a given subject-predicate combination (e.g., ranking the doctor and nurse professions high when speakers talk about patients, emergency rooms, etc).
result_label: Experiments with various conversational texts including Reddit discussions, movie scripts and a collection of crowdsourced personal dialogues demonstrate the viability of our methods and their superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TITLE: Say Anything: Using Textual Case-Based Reasoning to Enable Open-Domain Interactive Storytelling
ABSTRACT: background_label: We describe Say Anything, a new interactive storytelling system that collaboratively writes textual narratives with human users.
background_label: Unlike previous attempts, this interactive storytelling system places no restrictions on the content or direction of the user’s contribution to the emerging storyline.
background_label: In response to these contributions, the computer continues the storyline with narration that is both coherent and entertaining.
method_label: This capacity for open-domain interactive storytelling is enabled by an extremely large repository of nonfiction personal stories, which is used as a knowledge base in a case-based reasoning architecture.
method_label: In this article, we describe the three main components of our case-based reasoning approach: a million-item corpus of personal stories mined from internet weblogs, a case retrieval strategy that is optimized for narrative coherence, and an adaptation strategy that ensures that repurposed sentences from the case base are appropriate for the user’s emerging fiction.
result_label: We describe a series of evaluations of the system’s ability to produce coherent and entertaining stories, and we compare these narratives with single-author stories posted to internet weblogs.

TITLE: Interplay Between Personal Goals and Classroom Goal Structures in Predicting Student Outcomes: A Multilevel Analysis of Person-Context Interactions
ABSTRACT: background_label: This study examined cross-level interactions between personal goals and classroom goal structures, as well as their additive contributions to predicting math achievement, engagement, interest, effort withdrawal, and avoidance coping, using a sample of 3,943 Grade 5 students from 130 classrooms.
result_label: Results of hierarchical linear modeling showed that classroom performance goal structures exacerbated (a) the negative association between personal performance-avoidance goals and engagement and (b) the positive relations of personal performance-avoidance goals to effort withdrawal and avoidance coping.
result_label: Moreover, both classroom performance goal structures and personal performance-avoidance goals had maladaptive patterns of relations to outcomes at their respective levels of analysis, whereas classroom mastery goal structures and personal mastery goals showed adaptive relations.
result_label: Our findings underscore the importance of a multilevel interactionist perspective in understanding achievement motivation and making recommendations for educational practices.

TITLE: The Narrative Construction of Reality
ABSTRACT: background_label: Surely since the Enlightenment, if not before, the study of mind has centered principally on how man achieves a "true" knowledge of the world.
background_label: Emphasis in this pursuit has varied, of course: empiricists have concentrated on the mind's interplay with an external world of nature, hoping to find the key in the association of sensations and ideas, while rationalists have looked inward to the powers of mind itself for the principles of right reason.
objective_label: The objective, in either case, has been to discover how we achieve "reality," that is to say, how we get a reliable fix on the world, a world that is, as it were, assumed to be immutable and, as it were, "there to be observed."
background_label: This quest has, of course, had a profound effect on the development of psychology, and the empiricist and rationalist traditions have dominated our conceptions of how the mind grows and how it gets its grasp on the "real world."
background_label: Indeed, at midcentury Gestalt theory represented the rationalist wing of this enterprise and American learning theory the empiricist.
background_label: Both gave accounts of mental development as proceeding in some more or less linear and uniform fashion from an initial incompetence in grasping reality to a final competence, in one case attributing it to the working out of internal processes or mental organization, and in the other to some unspecified principle of reflection by which—whether through reinforcement, association, or conditioning—we came to respond to the world "as it is."

TITLE: Describing one’s subjective experience in the second person: An interview method for the science of consciousness
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This article presents an interview method which enables us to bring a person, who may not even have been trained, to become aware of his or her subjective experience, and describe it with great precision.
objective_label: It is focused on the difficulties of becoming aware of one’s subjective experience and describing it, and on the processes used by this interview technique to overcome each of these difficulties.
method_label: The article ends with a discussion of the criteria governing the validity of the descriptions obtained, and then with a brief review of the functions of these descriptions.

TITLE: Raising voice, risking retaliation: Events following interpersonal mistreatment in the workplace.
ABSTRACT: background_label: This study advances the literature on workplace deviance, addressing retaliation victimization in the context of interpersonal mistreatment.
method_label: Using survey data from 1,167 public-sector employees, the authors investigated experiences of work retaliation victimization and social retaliation victimization among employees who have vocally resisted interpersonal mistreatment.
method_label: Regression analyses suggest that different victim voice mechanisms trigger different forms of retaliation, depending on the social positions of the mistreatment victim and instigator.
result_label: Discriminant function analyses demonstrate lower professional, psychological, and physical well-being among mistreated employees who have been further victimized with retaliation.
result_label: These analyses also reveal health-related costs associated with victim silence--that is, enduring mistreatment without voicing resistance.
result_label: Results are interpreted in light of theory on power, emotions, and justice in organizations.

TITLE: Modelling the Socialization of Creative Agents in a Master-Apprentice Setting: The Case of Movie Title Puns
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper presents work on modelling the social psychological aspect of socialization in the case of a computationally creative master-apprentice system.
background_label: In each master-apprentice pair, the master, a genetic algorithm, is seen as a parent for its apprentice, which is an NMT based sequence-to-sequence model.
background_label: The effect of different parenting styles on the creative output of each pair is in the focus of this study.
result_label: This approach brings a novel view point to computational social creativity, which has mainly focused in the past on computationally creative agents being on a socially equal level, whereas our approach studies the phenomenon in the context of a social hierarchy.

TITLE: Understanding King Punisher and His Order: Vandalism in an Online Community - Motives, Meanings and Possible Solutions
ABSTRACT: background_label: Introduction Commonly online vandalism has been understood to mean the defacement or destruction of commercial, government or personal websites.
background_label: This is a rather parochial understanding of the phenomenon which marginalises other more esoteric, but nonetheless prevalent, acts of virtual property destruction.
background_label: Most notably, unique forms of online vandalism exist within graphical online communities, where virtual buildings, homes and memorials are often defaced and even destroyed.
method_label: Findings from an ethnographic study are used to examine the manifestation and regulation of this particular type of online deviance.
method_label: The study examines ‘deviance’ within a threedimensional online community named Cyberworlds.
method_label: The complex social structures within the computer engineered environment are explored, using online participant observation and online group discussions.
method_label: Work surrounding the aetiology and manifestation of offline vandalism is used in this paper in order to better understand this unique form of online deviance.
method_label: Primarily the work of Sutton (1987) is utilised in order to rationalise the activities of online vandal ‘gangs’ within Cyberworlds.
result_label: The paper also explores the possibility that situational crime prevention methods (Clarke 1983; 1995) are particularly suitable for tackling online vandalism.

TITLE: Inferring Which Medical Treatments Work from Reports of Clinical Trials
ABSTRACT: background_label: How do we know if a particular medical treatment actually works?
background_label: Ideally one would consult all available evidence from relevant clinical trials.
background_label: Unfortunately, such results are primarily disseminated in natural language scientific articles, imposing substantial burden on those trying to make sense of them.
objective_label: In this paper, we present a new task and corpus for making this unstructured evidence actionable.
method_label: The task entails inferring reported findings from a full-text article describing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with respect to a given intervention, comparator, and outcome of interest, e.g., inferring if an article provides evidence supporting the use of aspirin to reduce risk of stroke, as compared to placebo.
method_label: We present a new corpus for this task comprising 10,000+ prompts coupled with full-text articles describing RCTs.
result_label: Results using a suite of models --- ranging from heuristic (rule-based) approaches to attentive neural architectures --- demonstrate the difficulty of the task, which we believe largely owes to the lengthy, technical input texts.
other_label: To facilitate further work on this important, challenging problem we make the corpus, documentation, a website and leaderboard, and code for baselines and evaluation available at http://evidence-inference.ebm-nlp.com/.
