TITLE: Characterizing the Language of Online Communities and its Relation to Community Reception
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This work investigates style and topic aspects of language in online communities: looking at both utility as an identifier of the community and correlation with community reception of content.
method_label: Style is characterized using a hybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language model, while topic is represented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
result_label: Experiments with several Reddit forums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic, even for communities organized around specific topics.
result_label: Further, there is a positive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the style similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.

TITLE: Assessment of Effectiveness of Content Models for Approximating Twitter Social Connection Structures
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper explores the social quality (goodness) of community structures formed across Twitter users, where social links within the structures are estimated based upon semantic properties of user-generated content (corpus).
method_label: We examined the overlap of the community structures of the constructed graphs, and followership-based social communities, to find the social goodness of the links constructed.
method_label: Unigram, bigram and LDA content models were empirically investigated for evaluation of effectiveness, as approximators of underlying social graphs, such that they maintain the {\it community} social property.
method_label: Impact of content at varying granularities, for the purpose of predicting links while retaining the social community structures, was investigated.
method_label: 100 discussion topics, spanning over 10 Twitter events, were used for experiments.
result_label: The unigram language model performed the best, indicating strong similarity of word usage within deeply connected social communities.
result_label: This observation agrees with the phenomenon of evolution of word usage behavior, that transform individuals belonging to the same community tending to choose the same words, made by Danescu et al.
result_label: (2013), and raises a question on the literature that use, without validation, LDA for content-based social link prediction over other content models.
result_label: Also, semantically finer-grained content was observed to be more effective compared to coarser-grained content.

TITLE: The role of argumentation in online epistemic communities : the anatomy of a conflict in Wikipedia
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Motivation -- This research aims to investigate the processes by which knowledge objects --- in this case Wikipedia pages on astronomy --- are elaborated, in online communities, focussing on the role of argumentative interactions.
method_label: Research approach -- We articulate qualitative multidimensional analysis of online discussions, in relation to elaboration of Wikipedia pages, with automatic semantic and syntactic Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis focussed on identifying the roles of dialogical argumentation processes.
method_label: Findings/Design -- Knowledge objects in online communities are jointly shaped by socio-relational and epistemic processes.
method_label: Research limitations/Implications -- Our analysis method, based on previous research, is presently restricted to in-depth analysis of a small number of discussions.
objective_label: In ongoing work, our objective is to apply the method to the whole corpus of the Wikipedia astronomy online epistemic community.
result_label: Originality/Value -- Our qualitative analysis approach distinguishes multiple functions of dialogue applying to diverse contents (task, interlocutor-related), in relation to automatic NLP analysis.
result_label: Take away message -- The way that online epistemic communities function goes beyond knowledge-based discussion and argumentation, to involve negotiation of competencies of so-called 'experts' and 'amateurs'.

TITLE: Linguistic Style Matching In Social Interaction
ABSTRACT: background_label: Three experiments were conducted to determine the psychometric properties of language in dyadic interactions.
background_label: Using text-analysis, it was possible to assess the degree to which people coordinate their word use in natural conversations.
method_label: In Experiments 1 (n = 130) and 2( n = 32), college students interacted in dyadic conversations in laboratory-based private Internet chat rooms.
method_label: Experiment 3 analyzed the official transcripts of the Watergate tapes involving the dyadic interactions between President Richard Nixon and his aids H. R. Haldeman, John Erlichman, and John Dean.
result_label: The results of the three studies offer sub- stantial evidence that individuals in dyadic interactions exhibit linguistic style matching (LSM) on both the conversation level as well as on a turn-by-turn level.
result_label: Furthermore, LSM is unrelated to ratings of the quality of the interaction by both participants and judges.
result_label: We propose that a coordination-engagement hypothesis is a better description of linguistic behaviors than the coordination-rapport hypothesis that has been proposed in the nonver- bal literature.
background_label: For years social psychologists have exalted the power of the situa- tion.
background_label: We comfortably acknowledge that across different situations, with different people, we may act in a range of ways, or even talk using a variety of styles.
background_label: Aware of this tendency, Gergen (1972) began his explorations of our shifting masks of identity.
background_label: In writing letters to close friends, he realized that he came across as a "completely different per- son" in each letter.
other_label: "In one, I was morose, pouring out a philosophy of existential sorrow; in another I was a lusty realist: in a third I was a lighthearted jokester" (p. 32).
method_label: Based merely on his word choices, Gergen inadvertently varied his style to adapt to the recipients of his letters.
result_label: This is a prime demonstration of our inherent knowledge of the mutability of our language with respect to varying social contexts.

TITLE: All Who Wander: On the Prevalence and Characteristics of Multi-community Engagement
ABSTRACT: background_label: Although analyzing user behavior within individual communities is an active and rich research domain, people usually interact with multiple communities both on- and off-line.
background_label: How do users act in such multi-community environments?
background_label: Although there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has received much less attention in the research community in comparison to the intra-community case.
method_label: In this paper, we examine three aspects of multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the language that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users receive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source, and DBLP for auxiliary experiments.
method_label: We also demonstrate the effectiveness of features drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of activity.
method_label: One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the"settling-down"process in real life: an initial exploration of sub-communities before settling down into a few niches.
result_label: However, we find that the users in our data continually post in new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly among a more diverse set of smaller communities.
result_label: Interestingly, it seems that users that eventually leave the community are"destined"to do so from the very beginning, in the sense of showing significantly different"wandering"patterns very early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important design implications for community maintainers.
result_label: Our multi-community perspective also allows us to investigate the"situation vs. personality"debate from language usage across different communities.

TITLE: Language use as a reflection of socialization in online communities
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractIn this paper we investigate the connection between language and community membership of long time community participants through computational modeling techniques.
background_label: We report on findings from an analysis of language usage within a popular online discussion forum with participation of thousands of users spanning multiple years.
result_label: We find community norms of long time participants that are characterized by forum specific jargon and a style that is highly informal and shows familiarity with specific other participants and high emotional involvement in the discussion.
result_label: We also find quantitative evidence of persistent shifts in language usage towards these norms across users over the course of the first year of community participation.
result_label: Our observed patterns suggests language stabilization after 8 or 9 months of participation.

TITLE: Post language and user engagement in online content communities
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Purpose          This study aims to uncover relationships between content communities post language, such as parts of speech, and user engagement.
objective_label: Design/methodology/approach          Analyses of almost 12,000 posts from the content community Reddit are undertaken.
method_label: First, posts’ titles are subjected to electronic classification and subsequent counting of main parts of speech and other language elements.
method_label: Then, statistical models are built to examine the relationships between these elements and user engagement, controlling for variables identified in previous research.
result_label: Findings          The number of adjectives and nouns, adverbs, pronouns, punctuation (exclamation marks, quotation marks and ellipses), question marks, advisory words (should, shall, must and have to) and complexity indicators that appear in content community posts’ titles relate to post popularity (scores: number of favourable minus unfavourable votes) and number of comments.
result_label: However, these relationships vary according to the category, for example, text-based categories (e.g.
background_label: Politics and World News) vs image-based ones (e.g.
background_label: Pictures).
background_label: Research limitations/implications          While the relationships uncovered are appealing, this research is correlational, so causality cannot be implied.
background_label: Practical implications          Among other implications, companies may tailor their own content community post titles to match the types of language related to higher user engagement in a particular category.
result_label: Companies may also provide advice to brand ambassadors on how to make better use of language to increase user engagement.
result_label: Originality/value          This paper shows that language features add explained variance to models of online engagement variables, providing significant contribution to both language and social media researchers and practitioners.

TITLE: Are All Successful Communities Alike? Characterizing and Predicting the Success of Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: The proliferation of online communities has created exciting opportunities to study the mechanisms that explain group success.
background_label: While a growing body of research investigates community success through a single measure -- typically, the number of members -- we argue that there are multiple ways of measuring success.
objective_label: Here, we present a systematic study to understand the relations between these success definitions and test how well they can be predicted based on community properties and behaviors from the earliest period of a community's lifetime.
method_label: We identify four success measures that are desirable for most communities: (i) growth in the number of members; (ii) retention of members; (iii) long term survival of the community; and (iv) volume of activities within the community.
result_label: Surprisingly, we find that our measures do not exhibit very high correlations, suggesting that they capture different types of success.
result_label: Additionally, we find that different success measures are predicted by different attributes of online communities, suggesting that success can be achieved through different behaviors.
result_label: Our work sheds light on the basic understanding of what success represents in online communities and what predicts it.
result_label: Our results suggest that success is multi-faceted and cannot be measured nor predicted by a single measurement.
result_label: This insight has practical implications for the creation of new online communities and the design of platforms that facilitate such communities.

TITLE: Probing the audience of seniors' online communities.
ABSTRACT: background_label: OBJECTIVES Participation in online communities that are dedicated to older adults is a significant trend in elders' use of the Internet.
objective_label: The present study aimed to explore the audience of these communities and to discover possible subsegments within that audience and the differences among them.
method_label: METHODS The study was based on an online survey of 218 members of 16 English language-based seniors' online communities.
method_label: RESULTS Analysis demonstrated that the audience of the communities is not homogeneous, as 3 segments of community members were identified: information swappers, aging-oriented, and socializers.
method_label: These groups differed in their interests, background characteristics, and participation patterns.
result_label: In addition, results indicated significant differences between the groups in perceived benefits.
result_label: The socializers were those who reported the highest level of gratification.
result_label: The aging-oriented reported more "companionship" than the information swappers, and the latter reported more "joyfulness" than the aging-oriented.
result_label: CONCLUSIONS The results suggested that members of seniors' online communities actively select community contents that best meet their psychosocial needs and use the communities interchangeably with other media and activities.
result_label: Such purposeful use of the communities becomes an integral part of the strategies they utilize in order to cope with later life circumstances.

TITLE: Community-based topic modeling for social tagging
ABSTRACT: background_label: Exploring community is fundamental for uncovering the connections between structure and function of complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology.
method_label: In this paper, we propose a TTR-LDA-Community model which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA) and the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm with an inference mechanism.
method_label: The model is then applied to data from Delicious, a popular social tagging system, over the time period of 2005-2008.
result_label: Our results show that 1) users in the same community tend to be interested in similar set of topics in all time periods; and 2) topics may divide into several sub-topics and scatter into different communities over time.
result_label: We evaluate the effectiveness of our model and show that the TTR-LDA-Community model is meaningful for understanding communities and outperforms TTR-LDA and LDA models in tag prediction.

TITLE: Analyzing the network structure and gender differences among the members of the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) community
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we analyze a major part of the research output of the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) community in the period 2000 to 2016 from a network analytical perspective.
objective_label: We focus on the papers presented at the European and U.S. NKOS workshops and in addition four special issues on NKOS in the last 16 years.
method_label: For this purpose, we have generated an open dataset, the"NKOS bibliography"which covers the bibliographic information of the research output.
result_label: We analyze the co-authorship network of this community which results in 123 papers with a sum of 256 distinct authors.
result_label: We use standard network analytic measures such as degree, betweenness and closeness centrality to describe the co-authorship network of the NKOS dataset.
background_label: First, we investigate global properties of the network over time.
method_label: Second, we analyze the centrality of the authors in the NKOS network.
method_label: Lastly, we investigate gender differences in collaboration behavior in this community.
result_label: Our results show that apart from differences in centrality measures of the scholars, they have higher tendency to collaborate with those in the same institution or the same geographic proximity.
result_label: We also find that homophily is higher among women in this community.
result_label: Apart from small differences in closeness and clustering among men and women, we do not find any significant dissimilarities with respect to other centralities.

TITLE: An author-reader influence model for detecting topic-based influencers in social media
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This work addresses the problem of detecting topic-based influencers in social media.
method_label: For that end, we devise a novel behavioral model of authors and readers, where authors try to influence readers by generating ``\emph{attractive}" content, which is both \emph{relevant} and \emph{unique}, and readers can become authors themselves by further citing or referencing content made by other authors.
method_label: The model is realized by means of a content-based citation graph, where nodes represent authors with their generated content and edges represent reader-to-author citations.
method_label: To find the top influencers for a given topic, we first profile the content of authors (nodes) and citations (edges) and derive topic-based similarity scores to the topic, which further model the unique and relevant topic interests of users.
method_label: We then present three different extensions of the Topic-Sensitive PageRank algorithm that exploit the similarity scores to find topic-based influencers.
result_label: We evaluate our solution on a large real-world dataset that was gathered from Twitter by measuring information diffusion in social networks.
result_label: We show that, overall, our methods outperform several state-of-the-art methods.
result_label: This work further serves as an evidence that the topic uniqueness aspect in user interests within social media should be considered for the influencers detection task; this is in comparison to previous works that have solely focused on detecting topic-based influencers using the combination of link structure and topic-relevance.

TITLE: Extracting Topics with Focused Communities for Social Content Recommendation
ABSTRACT: background_label: A thorough understanding of social media discussions and the demographics of the users involved in these discussions has become critical for many applications like business or political analysis.
background_label: Such an understanding and its ramifications on the real world can be enabled through the automatic summarization of Social Media.
background_label: Trending topics are offered as a high level content recommendation system where users are suggested to view related content if they deem the displayed topics interesting.
objective_label: However, identifying the characteristics of the users focused on each topic can boost the importance even for topics that might not be popular or bursty.
method_label: We define a way to characterize groups of users that are focused in such topics and propose an efficient and accurate algorithm to extract such communities.
result_label: Through qualitative and quantitative experimentation we observe that topics with a strong community focus are interesting and more likely to catch the attention of users.

TITLE: Measuring Asymmetric Opinions on Online Social Interrelationship with Language and Network Features
ABSTRACT: background_label: Instead of studying the properties of social relationship from an objective view, in this paper, we focus on individuals' subjective and asymmetric opinions on their interrelationships.
background_label: Inspired by the theories from sociolinguistics, we investigate two individuals' opinions on their interrelationship with their interactive language features.
method_label: Eliminating the difference of personal language style, we clarify that the asymmetry of interactive language feature values can indicate individuals' asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship.
method_label: We also discuss how the degree of opinions' asymmetry is related to the individuals' personality traits.
method_label: Furthermore, to measure the individuals' asymmetric opinions on interrelationship concretely, we develop a novel model synthetizing interactive language and social network features.
result_label: The experimental results with Enron email dataset provide multiple evidences of the asymmetric opinions on interrelationship, and also verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in measuring the degree of opinions' asymmetry.

TITLE: Evolution of Reddit: From the Front Page of the Internet to a Self-referential Community?
ABSTRACT: background_label: In the past few years, Reddit -- a community-driven platform for submitting, commenting and rating links and text posts -- has grown exponentially, from a small community of users into one of the largest online communities on the Web.
method_label: To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive longitudinal study of Reddit's evolution to date, studying both (i) how user submissions have evolved over time and (ii) how the community's allocation of attention and its perception of submissions have changed over 5 years based on an analysis of almost 60 million submissions.
result_label: Our work reveals an ever-increasing diversification of topics accompanied by a simultaneous concentration towards a few selected domains both in terms of posted submissions as well as perception and attention.
result_label: By and large, our investigations suggest that Reddit has transformed itself from a dedicated gateway to the Web to an increasingly self-referential community that focuses on and reinforces its own user-generated image- and textual content over external sources.

TITLE: The meaning of an online health community in the lives of its members: roles, relationships and group dynamics
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This research is concerned with understanding the role a long established and thriving health bulletin board plays in the lives of its members; the impact of usability and sociability issues on group process, and the membership roles, patterns of social interaction, and group dynamics exhibited in the community.
method_label: An ethnographic research approach is taken in this study in combination with social network analysis, and Interaction Process Analysis.
method_label: The paper describes the rational for this research approach and some preliminary findings.
result_label: It appears that community members have created a mental model of the groups' dynamics that serves as the basis for their attraction and commitment to the community.

TITLE: No country for old members: user lifecycle and linguistic change in online communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: Vibrant online communities are in constant flux.
background_label: As members join and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating further changes to the membership and its social dynamics.
background_label: Linguistic change --- in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the norm --- is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates individual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity.
objective_label: We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it happens and for understanding how specific users react to these evolving norms.
method_label: By applying this framework to two large online communities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguistically innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by.
method_label: Building on this observation, we show how this framework can be used to detect, early in a user's career, how long she will stay active in the community.
result_label: Thus, this work has practical significance for those who design and maintain online communities.
result_label: It also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of linguistic norms and the complex interplay between community-level and individual-level linguistic change.

TITLE: Latent Community Topic Analysis: Integration of Community Discovery with Topic Modeling
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This article studies the problem of latent community topic analysis in text-associated graphs.
background_label: With the development of social media, a lot of user-generated content is available with user networks.
background_label: Along with rich information in networks, user graphs can be extended with text information associated with nodes.
background_label: Topic modeling is a classic problem in text mining and it is interesting to discover the latent topics in text-associated graphs.
method_label: Different from traditional topic modeling methods considering links, we incorporate community discovery into topic analysis in text-associated graphs to guarantee the topical coherence in the communities so that users in the same community are closely linked to each other and share common latent topics.
method_label: We handle topic modeling and community discovery in the same framework.
method_label: In our model we separate the concepts of community and topic, so one community can correspond to multiple topics and multiple communities can share the same topic.
method_label: We compare different methods and perform extensive experiments on two real datasets.
result_label: The results confirm our hypothesis that topics could help understand community structure, while community structure could help model topics.

TITLE: Learning Linguistic Descriptors of User Roles in Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractUnderstanding the ways in which users interact with different online communities is crucial to social network analysis and community maintenance.
objective_label: We present an unsupervised neural model to learn linguistic descriptors for a user's behavior over time within an online community.
method_label: We show that the descriptors learned by our model capture the functional roles that users occupy in communities, in contrast to those learned via a standard topic-modeling algorithm, which simply reflect topical content.
result_label: Experiments on the social media forum Reddit show how the model can provide interpretable insights into user behavior.
result_label: Our model uncovers linguistic differences that correlate with user activity levels and community clustering.

TITLE: Predicting Response to Political Blog Posts with Topic Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper we model discussions in online political blogs.
method_label: To do this, we extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), in various ways to capture different characteristics of the data.
method_label: Our models jointly describe the generation of the primary documents (posts) as well as the authorship and, optionally, the contents of the blog community's verbal reactions to each post (comments).
result_label: We evaluate our model on a novel comment prediction task where the models are used to predict which blog users will leave comments on a given post.
result_label: We also provide a qualitative discussion about what the models discover.

TITLE: Predicting the Popularity of Topics based on User Sentiment in Microblogging Websites
ABSTRACT: background_label: Behavioral economics show us that emotions play an important role in individual behavior and decision-making.
background_label: Does this also affect collective decision making in a community?
objective_label: Here we investigate whether the community sentiment energy of a topic is related to the spreading popularity of the topic.
method_label: To compute the community sentiment energy of a topic, we first analyze the sentiment of a user on the key phrases of the topic based on the recent tweets of the user.
method_label: Then we compute the total sentiment energy of all users in the community on the topic based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) model and graph entropy model.
result_label: Experiments on two communities find the linear correlation between the community sentiment energy and the real spreading popularity of topics.
method_label: Based on the finding, we proposed two models to predict the popularity of topics.
result_label: Experimental results show the effectiveness of the two models and the helpful of sentiment in predicting the popularity of topics.
result_label: Experiments also show that community sentiment affects collective decision making of spreading a topic or not in the community.

TITLE: On the relationship between the structural and socioacademic communities of an interdisciplinary coauthorship network
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractThis article presents a study that compares detected structural communities in a coauthorship network to the socioacademic characteristics of the scholars that compose the network.
method_label: The coauthorship network was created from the bibliographic record of an overt interdisciplinary research group focused on sensor networks and wireless communication.
method_label: The popular leading eigenvector community detection algorithm was employed to assign a structural community to each scholar in the network.
method_label: Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the scholars and include such information as their academic department, academic affiliation, country of origin, and academic position.
result_label: A Pearson's χ 2 test, with a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best represent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department and at the same institution.
result_label: A generalization of this result indicates that, contrary to the common conception of a multi-institutional interdisciplinary research group, collaboration is primarily driven by scholar expertise and physical proximity.

TITLE: Moderation, Response Rate, and Message Interactivity: Features of Online Communities and Their Effects on Intent to Participate
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractWe conducted two experiments to explore how moderation, response rate, and message interactivity affected people's intent to participate in a web-based online community.
background_label: In our first experiment, 62 participants observed either a moderated or an unmoderated online community and answered questions about their intent to participate in the community.
method_label: The participants who viewed the moderated community reported significantly higher intent to participate than participants who viewed the unmoderated community.
method_label: In our second experiment, 59 participants observed a different online community in which we manipulated both the rate (in time) of posted comments and the interactivity of each comment.
method_label: We derived our manipulation of interactivity from Rafaeli's (1988) definition of interactivity as message contingency.
result_label: Participants reported significantly greater intent to participate in an online community featuring interactive messages, but only when response rate was slow.
result_label: These results indicate that both structural features of interfaces and content features of interactions affect people's intent to participate in online communities.

background_label: While a growing body of research analyzes the formation of a single community by examining social networks between individuals, we introduce a novel community-centered perspective.
objective_label: We highlight the fact that the context in which a new community emerges contains numerous existing communities.
method_label: We reveal the emerging process of communities by tracing their early members' previous community memberships.
method_label: Our testbed is Reddit, a website that consists of tens of thousands of user-created communities.
result_label: We analyze a dataset that spans over a decade and includes the posting history of users on Reddit from its inception to April 2017.
background_label: We first propose a computational framework for building genealogy graphs between communities.
background_label: We present the first large-scale characterization of such genealogy graphs.
background_label: Surprisingly, basic graph properties, such as the number of parents and max parent weight, converge quickly despite the fact that the number of communities increases rapidly over time.
method_label: Furthermore, we investigate the connection between a community's origin and its future growth.
result_label: Our results show that strong parent connections are associated with future community growth, confirming the importance of existing community structures in which a new community emerges.
result_label: Finally, we turn to the individual level and examine the characteristics of early members.
result_label: We find that a diverse portfolio across existing communities is the most important predictor for becoming an early member in a new community.

TITLE: Retweet networks of the European Parliament: evaluation of the community structure
ABSTRACT: background_label: Analyzing information from social media to uncover underlying real-world phenomena is becoming widespread.
objective_label: The goal of this paper is to evaluate the role of Twitter in identifying communities of influence when the 'ground truth' is known.
method_label: We consider the European Parliament (EP) Twitter users during a period of one year, in which they posted over 560,000 tweets.
method_label: We represent the influence on Twitter by the number of retweets users get.
method_label: We construct two networks of influence: (i) core, where both users are the EP members, and (ii) extended, where one user can be outside the EP.
method_label: We compare the detected communities in both networks to the 'ground truth': the political group, country, and language of the EP members.
result_label: The results show that the core network closely matches the political groups, while the extended network best reflects the country of origin.
result_label: This provides empirical evidence that the formation of retweet networks and community detection are appropriate tools to reveal real-world relationships, and can be used to uncover hidden properties when the 'ground truth' is not known.

TITLE: On the Role of Social Identity and Cohesion in Characterizing Online Social Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: Two prevailing theories for explaining social group or community structure are cohesion and identity.
background_label: The social cohesion approach posits that social groups arise out of an aggregation of individuals that have mutual interpersonal attraction as they share common characteristics.
background_label: These characteristics can range from common interests to kinship ties and from social values to ethnic backgrounds.
background_label: In contrast, the social identity approach posits that an individual is likely to join a group based on an intrinsic self-evaluation at a cognitive or perceptual level.
background_label: In other words group members typically share an awareness of a common category membership.
objective_label: In this work we seek to understand the role of these two contrasting theories in explaining the behavior and stability of social communities in Twitter.
objective_label: A specific focal point of our work is to understand the role of these theories in disparate contexts ranging from disaster response to socio-political activism.
method_label: We extract social identity and social cohesion features-of-interest for large scale datasets of five real-world events and examine the effectiveness of such features in capturing behavioral characteristics and the stability of groups.
method_label: We also propose a novel measure of social group sustainability based on the divergence in group discussion.
result_label: Our main findings are: 1) Sharing of social identities (especially physical location) among group members has a positive impact on group sustainability, 2) Structural cohesion (represented by high group density and low average shortest path length) is a strong indicator of group sustainability, and 3) Event characteristics play a role in shaping group sustainability, as social groups in transient events behave differently from groups in events that last longer.

TITLE: Selecting an effective niche: an ecological view of the success of online communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online communities serve various important functions, but many fail to thrive.
background_label: Research on community success has traditionally focused on internal factors.
objective_label: In contrast, we take an ecological view to understand how the success of a community is influenced by other communities.
method_label: We measured a community's relationship with other communities - its "niche" - through four dimensions: topic overlap, shared members, content linking, and shared offline organizational affiliation.
method_label: We used a mixed-method approach, combining the quantitative analysis of 9495 online enterprise communities and interviews with community members.
result_label: Our results show that too little or too much overlap in topic with other communities causes a community's activity to suffer.
result_label: We also show that this main result is moderated in predictable ways by whether the community shares members with, links to content in, or shares an organizational affiliation with other communities.
result_label: These findings provide new insight on community success, guiding online community designers on how to effectively position their community in relation to others.

TITLE: Unpacking the Use of Social Media for Protest Behavior: The Roles of Information, Opinion Expression, and Activism
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent studies have shown a positive link between frequency of social media use and political participation.
background_label: However, there has been no clear elaboration of how using social media translates into increased political activity.
objective_label: The current study examines three explanations for this relationship in the context of citizens’ protest behavior: information (social media as a source for news), opinion expression (using social media to express political opinions), and activism (joining causes and finding mobilizing information through social media).
method_label: To test these relationships, the study uses survey data collected in Chile in 2011, amid massive demonstrations demanding wholesale changes in education and energy policy.
result_label: Findings suggest that using social media for opinion expression and activism mediates the relationship between overall social media use and protest behavior.
result_label: These findings deepen our knowledge of the uses and effects of social media and provide new evidence on the role of digital platforms as facili...

TITLE: Modeling community structure and topics in dynamic text networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: The last decade has seen great progress in both dynamic network modeling and topic modeling.
objective_label: This paper draws upon both areas to create a Bayesian method that allows topic discovery to inform the latent network model and the network structure to facilitate topic identification.
method_label: We apply this method to the 467 top political blogs of 2012.
result_label: Our results find complex community structure within this set of blogs, where community membership depends strongly upon the set of topics in which the blogger is interested.

TITLE: Role-based Label Propagation Algorithm for Community Detection
ABSTRACT: background_label: Community structure of networks provides comprehensive insight into their organizational structure and functional behavior.
background_label: LPA is one of the most commonly adopted community detection algorithms with nearly linear time complexity.
background_label: But it suffers from poor stability and occurrence of monster community due to the introduced randomize.
background_label: We note that different community-oriented node roles impact the label propagation in different ways.
method_label: In this paper, we propose a role-based label propagation algorithm (roLPA), in which the heuristics with regard to community-oriented node role were used.
method_label: We have evaluated the proposed algorithm on both real and artificial networks.
result_label: The result shows that roLPA is comparable to the state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.

TITLE: Brand community of convenience products: new forms of customer empowerment – the case “my Nutella The Community”
ABSTRACT: objective_label: Purpose – To analyse the power that a virtual brand community exerts over a brand of a mass‐marketed convenience product.
objective_label: To draw implications about the strategy that a company can employ facing this power shift.
method_label: To track emerging trends in virtual brand communities applied to convenience product (as opposed to niche or luxury goods).Design/methodology/approach – Case study of the web community “my Nutella The Community” promoted by the firm Ferrero in Italy.
result_label: The study applied multiple methods and was conducted through interviews with key informants, netnography and document analysis.Findings – The virtual community that gathers around a convenience product brand shows a new form of sociality and customer empowerment: it is not based on interaction between peers, but more on personal self‐exhibition in front of other consumers through the marks and rituals linked to the brand.
result_label: The company should play the role of non‐intrusive enabler of these personal expressions, reducing its control over the brand's mea...

TITLE: Sentiment-driven Community Profiling and Detection on Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Web 2.0 helps to expand the range and depth of conversation on many issues and facilitates the formation of online communities.
background_label: Online communities draw various individuals together based on their common opinions on a core set of issues.
background_label: Most existing community detection methods merely focus on discovering communities without providing any insight regarding the collective opinions of community members and the motives behind the formation of communities.
background_label: Several efforts have been made to tackle this problem by presenting a set of keywords as a community profile.
background_label: However, they neglect the positions of community members towards keywords, which play an important role for understanding communities in the highly polarized atmosphere of social media.
method_label: To this end, we present a sentiment-driven community profiling and detection framework which aims to provide community profiles presenting positive and negative collective opinions of community members separately.
method_label: With this regard, our framework initially extracts key expressions in users' messages as representative of issues and then identifies users' positive/negative attitudes towards these key expressions.
method_label: Next, it uncovers a low-dimensional latent space in order to cluster users according to their opinions and social interactions (i.e., retweets).
result_label: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TITLE: Style Transfer by Relaxed Optimal Transport and Self-Similarity
ABSTRACT: background_label: Style transfer algorithms strive to render the content of one image using the style of another.
objective_label: We propose Style Transfer by Relaxed Optimal Transport and Self-Similarity (STROTSS), a new optimization-based style transfer algorithm.
method_label: We extend our method to allow user-specified point-to-point or region-to-region control over visual similarity between the style image and the output.
method_label: Such guidance can be used to either achieve a particular visual effect or correct errors made by unconstrained style transfer.
method_label: In order to quantitatively compare our method to prior work, we conduct a large-scale user study designed to assess the style-content tradeoff across settings in style transfer algorithms.
result_label: Our results indicate that for any desired level of content preservation, our method provides higher quality stylization than prior work.

TITLE: A Dynamic Network Approach to the Assessment of Terrorist Groups and the Impact of Alternative Courses of Action
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract : Dynamic network analysis (DNA) is an emergent field centered on the collection, analysis, understanding and prediction of dynamic relations among various entities such as actors, events and resources and the impact of such dynamics on individual and group behaviour.
background_label: DNA facilitates reasoning about terrorist groups as complex dynamic networked systems that evolve over time.
method_label: An interoperable DNA toolchain for collecting data on, assessing the network of, and forecasting changes in that network is presented.
method_label: The use of these DNA tools to asses a terrorist group is then demonstrated using open source data.
method_label: Key techniques are demonstrated using a dataset collected on terror networks.
result_label: Techniques demonstrated include those for identification of an actor's sphere of influence, emergent leaders, and paths among critical actors, and metrics for assessing the potential immediate and near term impact of various courses of action.

TITLE: The Communication of Meaning and the Structuration of Expectations: Giddens'"structuration theory"and Luhmann's"self-organization"
ABSTRACT: background_label: The communication of meaning as different from (Shannon-type) information is central to Luhmann's social systems theory and Giddens' structuration theory of action.
background_label: These theories share an emphasis on reflexivity, but focus on meaning along a divide between inter-human communication and intentful action as two different systems of reference.
method_label: Recombining these two theories into a theory about the structuration of expectations, interactions, organization, and self-organization of intentional communications can be simulated based on algorithms from the computation of anticipatory systems.
method_label: The self-organizing and organizing layers remain rooted in the double contingency of the human encounter which provides the variation.
method_label: Organization and self-organization of communication are reflexive upon and therefore reconstructive of each other.
method_label: Using mutual information in three dimensions, the imprint of meaning processing in the modeling system on the historical organization of uncertainty in the modeled system can be measured.
result_label: This is shown empirically in the case of intellectual organization as"structurating"structure in the textual domain of scientific articles.

TITLE: The Extraction of Community Structures from Publication Networks to Support Ethnographic Observations of Field Differences in Scientific Communication
ABSTRACT: background_label: The scientific community of researchers in a research specialty is an important unit of analysis for understanding the field specific shaping of scientific communication practices.
background_label: These scientific communities are, however, a challenging unit of analysis to capture and compare because they overlap, have fuzzy boundaries, and evolve over time.
method_label: We describe a network analytic approach that reveals the complexities of these communities through examination of their publication networks in combination with insights from ethnographic field studies.
method_label: We suggest that the structures revealed indicate overlapping sub- communities within a research specialty and we provide evidence that they differ in disciplinary orientation and research practices.
objective_label: By mapping the community structures of scientific fields we aim to increase confidence about the domain of validity of ethnographic observations as well as of collaborative patterns extracted from publication networks thereby enabling the systematic study of field differences.
method_label: The network analytic methods presented include methods to optimize the delineation of a bibliographic data set in order to adequately represent a research specialty, and methods to extract community structures from this data.
result_label: We demonstrate the application of these methods in a case study of two research specialties in the physical and chemical sciences.

TITLE: Viscovery: Trend Tracking in Opinion Forums based on Dynamic Topic Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Opinions in forums and social networks are released by millions of people due to the increasing number of users that use Web 2.0 platforms to opine about brands and organizations.
background_label: For enterprises or government agencies it is almost impossible to track what people say producing a gap between user needs/expectations and organizations actions.
method_label: To bridge this gap we create Viscovery, a platform for opinion summarization and trend tracking that is able to analyze a stream of opinions recovered from forums.
method_label: To do this we use dynamic topic models, allowing to uncover the hidden structure of topics behind opinions, characterizing vocabulary dynamics.
method_label: We extend dynamic topic models for incremental learning, a key aspect needed in Viscovery for model updating in near-real time.
method_label: In addition, we include in Viscovery sentiment analysis, allowing to separate positive/negative words for a specific topic at different levels of granularity.
method_label: Viscovery allows to visualize representative opinions and terms in each topic.
method_label: At a coarse level of granularity, the dynamic of the topics can be analyzed using a 2D topic embedding, suggesting longitudinal topic merging or segmentation.
result_label: In this paper we report our experience developing this platform, sharing lessons learned and opportunities that arise from the use of sentiment analysis and topic modeling in real world applications.

TITLE: Online search of overlapping communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: A great deal of research has been conducted on modeling and discovering communities in complex networks.
background_label: In most real life networks, an object often participates in multiple overlapping communities.
background_label: In view of this, recent research has focused on mining overlapping communities in complex networks.
method_label: The algorithms essentially materialize a snapshot of the overlapping communities in the network.
method_label: This approach has three drawbacks, however.
method_label: First, the mining algorithm uses the same global criterion to decide whether a subgraph qualifies as a community.
method_label: In other words, the criterion is fixed and predetermined.
background_label: But in reality, communities for different vertices may have very different characteristics.
background_label: Second, it is costly, time consuming, and often unnecessary to find communities for an entire network.
background_label: Third, the approach does not support dynamically evolving networks.
method_label: In this paper, we focus on online search of overlapping communities, that is, given a query vertex, we find meaningful overlapping communities the vertex belongs to in an online manner.
method_label: In doing so, each search can use community criterion tailored for the vertex in the search.
method_label: To support this approach, we introduce a novel model for overlapping communities, and we provide theoretical guidelines for tuning the model.
method_label: We present several algorithms for online overlapping community search and we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the algorithms.
result_label: We also suggest many potential applications of our model and algorithms.

TITLE: A Method for Characterizing Communities in Dynamic Attributed Complex Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many methods have been proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic complex networks.
background_label: In its simplest form, a community structure takes the form of a partition of the node set.
background_label: From the modeling point of view, to be of some utility, this partition must then be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system.
method_label: However, if most of the existing works focus on defining methods for the detection of communities, only very few try to tackle this interpretation problem.
method_label: Moreover, the existing approaches are limited either in the type of data they handle, or by the nature of the results they output.
objective_label: In this work, we propose a method to efficiently support such a characterization task.
method_label: We first define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, topological measures, and nodal attributes.
method_label: We then describe how to identify the most emerging sequential patterns of this dataset, and use them to characterize the communities.
method_label: We also show how to detect unusual behavior in a community, and highlight outliers.
result_label: Finally, as an illustration, we apply our method to a network of scientific collaborations.

TITLE: The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Community Question has set the agenda for much or much of sociology.
background_label: It is the question of how large-scale social systemic divisions of labor affect the organization and content of primary ties.
method_label: Network analysis is proposed as a useful approach to the Community Question, because, by focusing on linkages, it avoids the a priori confinement of analysis to solidary groupings and territorial units.
method_label: Three contentions about the Question are evaluated: arguments that Community is Lost, Saved or Liberted.
method_label: Data are presented about the structure and use of the "intimate" networks of 845 adult residents of East York, Toronto.
method_label: Intimate networks are found to be prevalent, composed of both kin and nonkin, nonlocal, asymmetric, and of sparse density.
result_label: Help in dealing with both emergencies and everyday matters is available from almost all intimate networks, but from only a minority of intimate ties.
result_label: The data provide broad support for the Liberated argument, in conjunction with some portions of the Saved argument.

TITLE: Latent Relation Language Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we propose Latent Relation Language Models (LRLMs), a class of language models that parameterizes the joint distribution over the words in a document and the entities that occur therein via knowledge graph relations.
method_label: This model has a number of attractive properties: it not only improves language modeling performance, but is also able to annotate the posterior probability of entity spans for a given text through relations.
result_label: Experiments demonstrate empirical improvements over both a word-based baseline language model and a previous approach that incorporates knowledge graph information.
result_label: Qualitative analysis further demonstrates the proposed model's ability to learn to predict appropriate relations in context.

TITLE: Topic Modeling of Short Texts: A Pseudo-Document View
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented growth of online social media, which empower short texts as the prevalent format for information of Internet.
background_label: Given the nature of sparsity, however, short text topic modeling remains a critical yet much-watched challenge in both academy and industry.
background_label: Rich research efforts have been put on building different types of probabilistic topic models for short texts, among which the self aggregation methods without using auxiliary information become an emerging solution for providing informative cross-text word co-occurrences.
background_label: However, models along this line are still rarely seen, and the representative one Self-Aggregation Topic Model (SATM) is prone to overfitting and computationally expensive.
result_label: In light of this, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model called Pseudo-document-based Topic Model (PTM) for short text topic modeling.
background_label: PTM introduces the concept of pseudo document to implicitly aggregate short texts against data sparsity.
background_label: By modeling the topic distributions of latent pseudo documents rather than short texts, PTM is expected to gain excellent performance in both accuracy and efficiency.
method_label: A Sparsity-enhanced PTM (SPTM for short) is also proposed by applying Spike and Slab prior, with the purpose of eliminating undesired correlations between pseudo documents and latent topics.
result_label: Extensive experiments on various real-world data sets with state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the high quality of topics learned by PTM and its robustness with reduced training samples.
result_label: It is also interesting to show that i) SPTM gains a clear edge over PTM when the number of pseudo documents is relatively small, and ii) the constraint that a short text belongs to only one pseudo document is critically important for the success of PTM.
result_label: We finally take an in-depth semantic analysis to unveil directly the fabulous function of pseudo documents in finding cross-text word co-occurrences for topic modeling.

TITLE: Clustering short status messages: A topic model based approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recently, there has been an exponential rise in the use of online social media systems like Twitter and Facebook.
background_label: Even more usage has been observed during events related to natural disasters, political turmoil or other such crises.
background_label: Tweets or status messages are short and may not carry enough contextual clues.
background_label: Hence, applying traditional natural language processing algorithms on such data is challenging.
method_label: Topic model is a popular method for modeling term frequency occurrences for documents in a given corpus.
method_label: A topic basically consists of set of words that co-occur frequently.
background_label: Unsupervised nature allows topic models to be trained easily on datasets meant for specific domains.
method_label: We use the topic modeling feature of MALLET - a machine learning tool kit, to generate topic models from unlabelled data.
method_label: We propose a way to cluster tweets by using the topic distributions in each tweet.
method_label: We address the problem of determining which topic model is optimal for clustering tweets based on its clustering performances.
method_label: We also demonstrate a use case wherein we cluster Twitter users based on the content they tweet.
result_label: We back our research with experimental results and evaluations.

TITLE: Semi-automatic ontology extraction to create draft topic maps
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic maps are a Semantic Web technology that provides a human-oriented mechanism to encode knowledge by organizing web information around topics.
background_label: Studies have shown, however, that authors face major difficulties in constructing topic maps.
objective_label: This paper discusses an approach to automatic construction of a "draft" topic map for the authors to start with.
objective_label: The idea is to extract topic map constructs by crawling a website and parsing its pages.
method_label: We propose a set of heuristics that can be used for extracting semantic information from the HTML markup of the web pages.
method_label: We have used this approach to design and implement a plug-in for the topic map editor TM4L that automatically extracts topics and relationships from a website specified by the author.
result_label: An evaluation of the proposed approach in terms of Recall and Precision of the extracted data is presented.

TITLE: Finding Optimal Policies for Online Communities with CoSiMo
ABSTRACT: background_label: The rapidly increasing popularity of Web 2.0 online communities originates in the ease of collaborative content creation and its sharing.
background_label: As a result, more community members actively participate in the community and its data growth rates are continuously increasing.
background_label: This poses the challenge for community platform operators on efficient administration and moderation to ensure the quality of content and to prevent violations of laws (e.g.
background_label: copyright, privacy, illegal content) and community rules.
background_label: Involvement of employed administrators who read and approve every piece of user-generated content is clearly the safest way of quality assurance.
result_label: Since this is a time consuming task it does not scale up with Web 2.0 dimensions.
background_label: So administrative functions are delegated to members of the community, the moderators.
background_label: The strategy for choosing trustworthy moderators in big anonymous communities is specified in policies based on user reputation that is measured in bonus points.
background_label: The proper balancing between community self-management and administration is crucial for the quality, attractiveness, and scalability of the entire community.
background_label: Therefore understanding the mutual influences between community actors, reputation systems and platform policies that employ user reputation is crucial to ensure the overall quality, user acceptance, and success of the entire online community.
objective_label: Our objective is to predict the behavior in an online community for different policies, which may result in different overall quality of the community content.
method_label: For this purpose we present our community analysis framework CoSiMo (an acronym for Community Simulation and Modeling), which employs the model-based approach for predicting the impact of policies on community dynamics and health.
result_label: Through systematic variation of simulated quality assurance mechanisms we show that our model plausibly captures the influence of policies to content quality and can be therefore exploited for optimization of real online communities.

TITLE: Unsupervised Topic Discovery by Anomaly Detection
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract : With the vast amount of information and public comment available online, it is of increasing interest to understand what is being said and what topics are trending online.
background_label: Government agencies, for example, want to know what policies concern the public without having to look through thousands of comments manually.
background_label: Topic detection provides automatic identification of topics in documents based on the information content and enhances many natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and information retrieval.
background_label: Unsupervised topic detection, however, has always been a difficult task.
method_label: Methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) convert documents from word space into document space (weighted sums over topic space), but do not perform any form of classification, nor do they address the relation of generated topics with actual human level topics.
objective_label: In this thesis we attempt a novel way of unsupervised topic detection and classification by performing LDA and then clustering.
method_label: We propose variations to the popular K-Mean Clustering algorithm to optimize the choice of centroids, and we perform experiments using Facebook data and the New York Times (NYT) corpus.
result_label: Although the results were poor for the Facebook data, our method performed acceptably with the NYT data.
result_label: The new clustering algorithms also performed slightly and consistently better than the normal K-Means algorithm.

TITLE: Latent dirichlet allocation: stability and applications to studies of user-generated content
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic modeling, in particular the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, has recently emerged as an important tool for understanding large datasets, in particular, user-generated datasets in social studies of the Web.
objective_label: In this work, we investigate the instability of LDA inference, propose a new metric of similarity between topics and a criterion of vocabulary reduction.
result_label: We show the limitations of the LDA approach for the purposes of qualitative analysis in social science and sketch some ways for improvement.

TITLE: The Skipping Behavior of Users of Music Streaming Services and its Relation to Musical Structure
ABSTRACT: background_label: The behavior of users of music streaming services is investigated from the point of view of the temporal dimension of individual songs; specifically, the main object of the analysis is the point in time within a song at which users stop listening and start streaming another song ("skip").
objective_label: The main contribution of this study is the ascertainment of a correlation between the distribution in time of skipping events and the musical structure of songs.
method_label: It is also shown that such distribution is not only specific to the individual songs, but also independent of the cohort of users and, under stationary conditions, date of observation.
result_label: Finally, user behavioral data is used to train a predictor of the musical structure of a song solely from its acoustic content; it is shown that the use of such data, available in large quantities to music streaming services, yields significant improvements in accuracy over the customary fashion of training this class of algorithms, in which only smaller amounts of hand-labeled data are available.

TITLE: Pollen Morphology and Its Relationship to Taxonomy of the Genus Sarracenia (Sarraceniaceae)
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract Despite nearly a century of research, the systematic relationships among North American pitcher plants in the genus Sarracenia (Sarraceniaceae) remain unresolved.
objective_label: In this study we analyzed pollen morphology of the 11 currently recognized species of Sarracenia and examined how variations in key pollen characteristics relate to our current understanding of the taxonomy of this genus.
method_label: We used principal components analysis to explore variations in pollen grain size (equatorial diameter and length) and shape (number of colpi) among Sarracenia species, and used cluster analysis to compare systematic groupings of Sarracenia based on floral, vegetative, and pollen characters.
method_label: We compared these results with a previously published phylogeny based on molecular data.
result_label: Groupings based on pollen characteristics alone did not align completely with those based on molecular or all morphological data.
result_label: In clusters based on pollen alone and those using all morphological characters, S. purpurea and S. rosea formed a single group, and S. flava, S. alata, and S. leucophylla grouped together consistently.
result_label: The pollen morphology of S. jonesii and S. alabamensis differed substantially from that of S. rubra, supporting the current systematic treatment of the genus that recognizes these three taxa as distinct species.

TITLE: PET: a statistical model for popular events tracking in social communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: User generated information in online communities has been characterized with the mixture of a text stream and a network structure both changing over time.
background_label: A good example is a web-blogging community with the daily blog posts and a social network of bloggers.
background_label: An important task of analyzing an online community is to observe and track the popular events, or topics that evolve over time in the community.
background_label: Existing approaches usually focus on either the burstiness of topics or the evolution of networks, but ignoring the interplay between textual topics and network structures.
objective_label: In this paper, we formally define the problem of popular event tracking in online communities (PET), focusing on the interplay between texts and networks.
method_label: We propose a novel statistical method that models the the popularity of events over time, taking into consideration the burstiness of user interest, information diffusion on the network structure, and the evolution of textual topics.
method_label: Specifically, a Gibbs Random Field is defined to model the influence of historic status and the dependency relationships in the graph; thereafter a topic model generates the words in text content of the event, regularized by the Gibbs Random Field.
result_label: We prove that two classic models in information diffusion and text burstiness are special cases of our model under certain situations.
result_label: Empirical experiments with two different communities and datasets (i.e., Twitter and DBLP) show that our approach is effective and outperforms existing approaches.

TITLE: Information Theory and its Relation to Machine Learning
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this position paper, I first describe a new perspective on machine learning (ML) by four basic problems (or levels), namely,"What to learn?
other_label: ","How to learn?
other_label: ","What to evaluate?
background_label: ", and"What to adjust?".
other_label: The paper stresses more on the first level of"What to learn?
objective_label: ", or"Learning Target Selection".
method_label: Towards this primary problem within the four levels, I briefly review the existing studies about the connection between information theoretical learning (ITL [1]) and machine learning.
method_label: A theorem is given on the relation between the empirically-defined similarity measure and information measures.
result_label: Finally, a conjecture is proposed for pursuing a unified mathematical interpretation to learning target selection.

TITLE: Language Style Transfer from Sentences with Arbitrary Unknown Styles
ABSTRACT: background_label: Language style transfer is the problem of migrating the content of a source sentence to a target style.
background_label: In many of its applications, parallel training data are not available and source sentences to be transferred may have arbitrary and unknown styles.
background_label: First, each sentence is encoded into its content and style latent representations.
method_label: Then, by recombining the content with the target style, we decode a sentence aligned in the target domain.
method_label: To adequately constrain the encoding and decoding functions, we couple them with two loss functions.
method_label: The first is a style discrepancy loss, enforcing that the style representation accurately encodes the style information guided by the discrepancy between the sentence style and the target style.
method_label: The second is a cycle consistency loss, which ensures that the transferred sentence should preserve the content of the original sentence disentangled from its style.
result_label: We validate the effectiveness of our model in three tasks: sentiment modification of restaurant reviews, dialog response revision with a romantic style, and sentence rewriting with a Shakespearean style.

method_label: In order to do so, we analyze a specific network of researchers by looking at the CASCON conference paper co-authorship structure.
method_label: CASCON is an annual International Conference hosted by the Centre for Advanced Studies, IBM Canada Software Laboratory.
result_label: We utilize the Social Network Analysis framework to understand what characterizes the social structure of the CASCON research paper network and, based on our findings, we offer preliminary insights regarding potential actions that can be taken to further develop the CASCON and other similar communities.

TITLE: Community Detection Algorithm Evaluation using Size and Hashtags
ABSTRACT: background_label: Understanding community structure in social media is critical due to its broad applications such as friend recommendations, link predictions and collaborative filtering.
background_label: However, there is no widely accepted definition of community in literature.
background_label: Existing work use structure related metrics such as modularity and function related metrics such as ground truth to measure the performance of community detection algorithms, while ignoring an important metric, size of the community.
background_label: [1] suggests that the size of community with strong ties in social media should be limited to 150.
background_label: As we discovered in this paper, the majority of the communities obtained by many popular community detection algorithms are either very small or very large.
background_label: Too small communities don't have practical value and too large communities contain weak connections therefore not stable.
method_label: In this paper, we compare various community detection algorithms considering the following metrics: size of the communities, coverage of the communities, extended modularity, triangle participation ratio, and user interest in the same community.
method_label: We also propose a simple clique based algorithm for community detection as a baseline for the comparison.
result_label: Experimental results show that both our proposed algorithm and the well-accepted disjoint algorithm InfoMap perform well in all the metrics.

TITLE: The dual-sparse topic model: mining focused topics and focused terms in short text
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic modeling has been proved to be an effective method for exploratory text mining.
background_label: It is a common assumption of most topic models that a document is generated from a mixture of topics.
background_label: In real-world scenarios, individual documents usually concentrate on several salient topics instead of covering a wide variety of topics.
background_label: A real topic also adopts a narrow range of terms instead of a wide coverage of the vocabulary.
method_label: Understanding this sparsity of information is especially important for analyzing user-generated Web content and social media, which are featured as extremely short posts and condensed discussions.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a dual-sparse topic model that addresses the sparsity in both the topic mixtures and the word usage.
method_label: By applying a "Spike and Slab" prior to decouple the sparsity and smoothness of the document-topic and topic-word distributions, we allow individual documents to select a few focused topics and a topic to select focused terms, respectively.
result_label: Experiments on different genres of large corpora demonstrate that the dual-sparse topic model outperforms both classical topic models and existing sparsity-enhanced topic models.
result_label: This improvement is especially notable on collections of short documents.

TITLE: Hidden sentiment association in Chinese web opinion mining. WWW
ABSTRACT: background_label: The boom of product review websites, blogs and forums on the web has attracted many research efforts on opinion mining.
background_label: Recently, there was a growing interest in the finer-grained opinion mining, which detects opinions on different review features as opposed to the whole review level.
background_label: The researches on feature-level opinion mining mainly rely on identifying the explicit relatedness between product feature words and opinion words in reviews.
background_label: However, the sentiment relatedness between the two objects is usually complicated.
background_label: For many cases, product feature words are implied by the opinion words in reviews.
background_label: The detection of such hidden sentiment association is still a big challenge in opinion mining.
result_label: Especially, it is an even harder task of feature-level opinion mining on Chinese reviews due to the nature of Chinese language.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a novel mutual reinforcement approach to deal with the feature-level opinion mining problem.
method_label: More specially, 1) the approach clusters product features and opinion words simultaneously and iteratively by fusing both their content information and sentiment link information.
method_label: 2) under the same framework, based on the product feature categories and opinion word groups, we construct the sentiment association set between the two groups of data objects by identifying their strongest n sentiment links.
method_label: Moreover, knowledge from multi-source is incorporated to enhance clustering in the procedure.
method_label: Based on the pre-constructed association set, our approach can largely predict opinions relating to different product features, even for the case without the explicit appearance of product feature words in reviews.
method_label: Thus it provides a more accurate opinion evaluation.
result_label: The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms.

TITLE: Community structure and the evolution of interdisciplinarity in Slovenia's scientific collaboration network
ABSTRACT: background_label: Interaction among the scientific disciplines is of vital importance in modern science.
background_label: Focusing on the case of Slovenia, we study the dynamics of interdisciplinary sciences from 1960 to 2010.
method_label: Our approach relies on quantifying the interdisciplinarity of research communities detected in the coauthorship network of Slovenian scientists over time.
method_label: Examining the evolution of the community structure, we find that the frequency of interdisciplinary research is only proportional with the overall growth of the network.
result_label: Although marginal improvements in favor of interdisciplinarity are inferable during the 70s and 80s, the overall trends during the past 20 years are constant and indicative of stalemate.
result_label: We conclude that the flow of knowledge between different fields of research in Slovenia is in need of further stimulation.

TITLE: Characterizing privacy in online social networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online social networks (OSNs) with half a billion users have dramatically raised concerns on privacy leakage.
background_label: Users, often willingly, share personal identifying information about themselves, but do not have a clear idea of who accesses their private information or what portion of it really needs to be accessed.
objective_label: In this study we examine popular OSNs from a viewpoint of characterizing potential privacy leakage.
method_label: Our study identifies what bits of information are currently being shared, how widely, and what users can do to prevent such sharing.
method_label: We also examine the role of third-party sites that track OSN users and compare with privacy leakage on popular traditional Web sites.
objective_label: Our long term goal is to identify the narrow set of private information that users really need to share to accomplish specific interactions on OSNs.

TITLE: Seriousness of Social Dilemmas and the Provision of a Sanctioning System
ABSTRACT: background_label: Two types of cooperation can be distinguished in social dilemmas.
background_label: Elementary cooperation occurs when members cooperate for the benefit of the collectivity.
background_label: Instrumental cooperation occurs when members cooperate to introduce a change in the incentive structure (such as the provision of a sanctioning system) so as to eliminate the dilemma from the original situation.
result_label: The results of a social dilemma experiment, using 48 same-sex four-person groups, indicate that (a) in the absence of a sanctioning system, greater temptation to defect makes the subjects cooperate less fully, whereas (b) when opportunities to cooperate in a sanctioning system exist, greater temptation to defect in the original dilemma makes the subjects cooperate more fully for the provision or maintenance of the sanctioning system when the gain for cooperation is large.
result_label: The implication of these findings is that as the social dilemma becomes more serious, people become more willing to cooperate in providing a change in the system which addresses the dilemma problem.

TITLE: A Joint Model of Conversational Discourse and Latent Topics on Microblogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Conventional topic models are ineffective for topic extraction from microblog messages, because the data sparseness exhibited in short messages lacking structure and contexts results in poor message-level word co-occurrence patterns.
method_label: To address this issue, we organize microblog messages as conversation trees based on their reposting and replying relations, and propose an unsupervised model that jointly learns word distributions to represent: 1) different roles of conversational discourse, 2) various latent topics in reflecting content information.
method_label: By explicitly distinguishing the probabilities of messages with varying discourse roles in containing topical words, our model is able to discover clusters of discourse words that are indicative of topical content.
method_label: In an automatic evaluation on large-scale microblog corpora, our joint model yields topics with better coherence scores than competitive topic models from previous studies.
result_label: Qualitative analysis on model outputs indicates that our model induces meaningful representations for both discourse and topics.
result_label: We further present an empirical study on microblog summarization based on the outputs of our joint model.
result_label: The results show that the jointly modeled discourse and topic representations can effectively indicate summary-worthy content in microblog conversations.

TITLE: From the User to the Medium: Neural Profiling Across Web Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online communities provide a unique way for individuals to access information from those in similar circumstances, which can be critical for health conditions that require daily and personalized management.
background_label: As these groups and topics often arise organically, identifying the types of topics discussed is necessary to understand their needs.
background_label: As well, these communities and people in them can be quite diverse, and existing community detection methods have not been extended towards evaluating these heterogeneities.
method_label: This has been limited as community detection methodologies have not focused on community detection based on semantic relations between textual features of the user-generated content.
method_label: Thus here we develop an approach, NeuroCom, that optimally finds dense groups of users as communities in a latent space inferred by neural representation of published contents of users.
result_label: By embedding of words and messages, we show that NeuroCom demonstrates improved clustering and identifies more nuanced discussion topics in contrast to other common unsupervised learning approaches.

TITLE: A path-based model for emotion abstraction on facebook using sentiment analysis and taxonomy knowledge
ABSTRACT: background_label: Each term in a short text can potentially convey emotional meaning.
background_label: Facebook comments and shared posts often convey human biases, which play a pivotal role in information spreading and content consumption.
background_label: Such bias is at the basis of human-generated content, and capable of conveying contexts which shape the opinion of users through the social media flow of information.
background_label: Starting from the observation that a separation in topic clusters, i.e.
method_label: sub-contexts, spontaneously occur if evaluated by human common sense, this work introduces a process for automated extraction of sub-context in Facebook.
method_label: Basing on emotional abstraction and valence, the automated extraction is exploited through a class of path-based semantic similarity measures and sentiment analysis.
result_label: Experimental results are obtained using validated clustering techniques on such features, on the domain of information security, over a sample of over 9 million page users.
result_label: An additional expert evaluation of clusters in tag clouds confirms that the proposed automated algorithm for emotional abstraction clusters Facebook comments compatibly with human common sense.
result_label: The baseline methods rely on the robust notion of collective concept similarity.

TITLE: Community Detection based on Structural and Attribute Similarities
ABSTRACT: background_label: The study of social networks has gained much interest from the research community in recent years.
objective_label: One important challenge is to search for communities in social networks.
background_label: A community is defined as a group of users such that they interact with each other more frequently than with those outside the group.
background_label: Being able to identify the community structure can facilitate many tasks such as recommendation of friends, network analysis and visualization.
background_label: In real-world networks, in addition to topological structure (i.e., links), content information is also available.
method_label: Existing community detection methods are usually based on the structural features and do not take into account the attributes of nodes.
method_label: In this paper, we propose two algorithms that use both structural and attribute information to extract communities.
method_label: Our methods partition a graph with attributes into communities so that the nodes in the same community are densely connected as well as homogeneous.
result_label: Experimental results demonstrate that our methods provide more meaningful communities than conven- tional methods that consider only relationship information.

ABSTRACT: background_label: Automated evaluation of topic quality remains an important unsolved problem in topic modeling and represents a major obstacle for development and evaluation of new topic models.

result_label: In this work, we propose several new metrics for evaluating topic quality with the help of distributed word representations; our experiments suggest that the new metrics are a better match for human judgement, which is the gold standard in this case, than previously developed approaches.

TITLE: Topic modeling with network regularization
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this paper, we formally define the problem of topic modeling with network structure (TMN).
objective_label: We propose a novel solution to this problem, which regularizes a statistical topic model with a harmonic regularizer based on a graph structure in the data.
method_label: The proposed method bridges topic modeling and social network analysis, which leverages the power of both statistical topic models and discrete regularization.
method_label: The output of this model well summarizes topics in text, maps a topic on the network, and discovers topical communities.
method_label: With concrete selection of a topic model and a graph-based regularizer, our model can be applied to text mining problems such as author-topic analysis, community discovery, and spatial text mining.
result_label: Empirical experiments on two different genres of data show that our approach is effective, which improves text-oriented methods as well as network-oriented methods.
result_label: The proposed model is general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and an associated network structure.

TITLE: Relay-Assisted Multiple Access with Multi-Packet Reception Capability and Simultaneous Transmission and Reception
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this work we examine the operation of a node relaying packets from a number of users to a destination node.
background_label: We assume multi-packet reception capabilities for the relay and the destination node.
background_label: The relay node can transmit and receive at the same time, so the problem of self interference arises.
background_label: The relay does not have packets of its own and the traffic at the source nodes is considered saturated.
method_label: The relay node stores a source packet that it receives successfully in its queue when the transmission to the destination node has failed.
method_label: We obtain analytical expressions for the characteristics of the relay's queue (such as arrival and service rate of the relay's queue), the stability condition and the average length of the queue as functions of the probabilities of transmissions, the self interference coefficient and the outage probabilities of the links.
result_label: We study the impact of the relay node and the self interference coefficient on the throughput per user-source as well as the aggregate throughput.

TITLE: Topic Modeling for Media and Communication Research: A Short Primer
ABSTRACT: background_label: A variety of powerful tools for the automated and semi-automated analysis of textual data are increasingly at the disposal of media and communication researchers.
background_label: Among the assemblage of methods, the school of techniques known as topic modeling has recently attracted particular interest.
background_label: What utility does one popular type of topic model, latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), have for media and communication research?
objective_label: This paper illustrates some distinct strengths and weaknesses of LDA.
method_label: We first briefly introduce its conceptual foundations, along with a selection of studies from the social sciences that apply it to different types of content, from newspapers and scientific publications to literary texts and social media.
method_label: We then present a case study of news coverage of the Syrian civil war.
method_label: After describing our data, we turn to two facets of the results in particular: the relation of terms and topics and the proportions of topics in documents, aggregated into months.
result_label: We make the case for contrastive (rather than descriptive) uses of topic modeling that build broader analyses on the initial output of a model, rather than concluding with a list of terms.

TITLE: Leveraging Conversation Structure on Social Media to Identify Potentially Influential Users
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social networks have a community providing feedback on comments that allows to identify opinion leaders and users whose positions are unwelcome.
background_label: Other platforms are not backed by such tools.

objective_label: In this work we propose a novel approach using Abstract Argumentation Frameworks and machine learning to describe interactions between users.
result_label: Our experiments provide evidence that modelling the flow of a conversation with the primitives of AAF can support the identification of users who produce consistently appreciated content without modelling such content.

TITLE: Twitter-Network Topic Model: A Full Bayesian Treatment for Social Network and Text Modeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Twitter data is extremely noisy -- each tweet is short, unstructured and with informal language, a challenge for current topic modeling.
background_label: On the other hand, tweets are accompanied by extra information such as authorship, hashtags and the user-follower network.
objective_label: Exploiting this additional information, we propose the Twitter-Network (TN) topic model to jointly model the text and the social network in a full Bayesian nonparametric way.
method_label: The TN topic model employs the hierarchical Poisson-Dirichlet processes (PDP) for text modeling and a Gaussian process random function model for social network modeling.
method_label: We show that the TN topic model significantly outperforms several existing nonparametric models due to its flexibility.
method_label: Moreover, the TN topic model enables additional informative inference such as authors' interests, hashtag analysis, as well as leading to further applications such as author recommendation, automatic topic labeling and hashtag suggestion.
result_label: Note our general inference framework can readily be applied to other topic models with embedded PDP nodes.

TITLE: What makes us a community: structure, correlations, and success in scientific world
ABSTRACT: background_label: We explore the statistical structure of scientific community based on multivariate analysis of publication (or other identifiable metrics) distribution in the author space.
background_label: Here, we define community based on keywords, i.e.
method_label: projecting semantic content of the documents on predefined meanings; however, more complex approaches based on semantic clustering of publications are possible.
method_label: Remarkably, this simple statistical analysis of publication metadata allows understanding of internal interactions with community in general agreement with experience acquired over decades of social interaction within it.
result_label: We further discuss potential applications of this approach for ranking within the community, reviewer selection, and optimization of community output.

TITLE: Polylingual Topic Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections, but have previously been applied in only monolingual, or at most bilingual, contexts.
background_label: Meanwhile, massive collections of interlinked documents in dozens of languages, such as Wikipedia, are now widely available, calling for tools that can characterize content in many languages.
objective_label: We introduce a polylingual topic model that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.
result_label: We explore the model's characteristics using two large corpora, each with over ten different languages, and demonstrate its usefulness in supporting machine translation and tracking topic trends across languages.

TITLE: SITS: A Hierarchical Nonparametric Model using Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation in Multiparty Conversations
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractOne of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments.
background_label: However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used.
method_label: We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics.
result_label: We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including personspecific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates.
result_label: Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual's tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire.

TITLE: Tweet2Vec: Character-Based Distributed Representations for Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Text from social media provides a set of challenges that can cause traditional NLP approaches to fail.
background_label: Informal language, spelling errors, abbreviations, and special characters are all commonplace in these posts, leading to a prohibitively large vocabulary size for word-level approaches.
method_label: We propose a character composition model, tweet2vec, which finds vector-space representations of whole tweets by learning complex, non-local dependencies in character sequences.
method_label: The proposed model outperforms a word-level baseline at predicting user-annotated hashtags associated with the posts, doing significantly better when the input contains many out-of-vocabulary words or unusual character sequences.
result_label: Our tweet2vec encoder is publicly available.

TITLE: The Influence and Deception of Twitter: The Authenticity of the Narrative and Slacktivism in the Australian Electoral Process
ABSTRACT: background_label: 1 Edith Cowan University School of Computer and Security Science 2 ECU Security Research Institute d.cook@ecu.edu.au Abstract It is uncertain how many discreet users occupy the social media community.
background_label: Fake tweets, sock puppets, forcemultipliers and botnets have become embedded within the fabric of new media in sufficient numbers that social media support by means of quantity is no longer a reliable metric for determining authority and influence within openly expressed issues and causes.
background_label: Election campaigns, and their associated political agendas, can now be influenced by non-specific virtual presences that cajole and redirect opinions without declaring identity or allegiance.
method_label: In the lead up to the 2013 Australian Federal Election, the open source Twitter activity for the two major party leaders was examined in order to establish patterns of information diffusion.
result_label: The results showed fake online personas, fake bots deploying automated Twitter dissemination, and deceptive Twitter strategies.
result_label: New media tolerates slacktivism, where Twitter users mistake auto-narrative for genuine political sentiment.
result_label: This study demonstrates the need to increase legitimacy and validity in micro-blogging forms of new media.

TITLE: Finding and Characterizing Communities in Multidimensional Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Complex networks have been receiving increasing attention by the scientific community, also due to the availability of massive network data from diverse domains.
background_label: One problem studied so far in complex network analysis is Community Discovery, i.e.
background_label: the detection of group of nodes densely connected, or highly related.
background_label: However, one aspect of such networks has been disregarded so far: real networks are often multidimensional, i.e.
background_label: many connections may reside between any two nodes, either to reflect different kinds of relationships, or to connect nodes by different values of the same type of tie.
background_label: In this context, the problem of Community Discovery has to be redefined, taking into account multidimensionality.
method_label: In this paper, we attempt to do so, by defining the problem in the multidimensional context, and by introducing also a new measure able to characterize the communities found.
method_label: We then provide a complete framework for finding and characterizing multidimensional communities.
result_label: Our experiments on real world multidimensional networks support the methodology proposed in this paper, and open the way for a new class of algorithms, aimed at capturing the multifaceted complexity of connections among nodes in a network.

objective_label: Our approach is to develop probabilistic models that would provide a good framework for such studies.
method_label: Thus, we propose here a new model, ccLDA, which extends over the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and cross-collection mixture (ccMix) (Zhai et al., 2004) models on blogs and forums.
method_label: We also provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the model on the cross-cultural data.

TITLE: SLPA: Uncovering Overlapping Communities in Social Networks via A Speaker-listener Interaction Dynamic Process
ABSTRACT: background_label: Overlap is one of the characteristics of social networks, in which a person may belong to more than one social group.
background_label: For this reason, discovering overlapping structures is necessary for realistic social analysis.
objective_label: In this paper, we present a novel, general framework to detect and analyze both individual overlapping nodes and entire communities.
method_label: In this framework, nodes exchange labels according to dynamic interaction rules.
result_label: A specific implementation called Speaker-listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA1) demonstrates an excellent performance in identifying both overlapping nodes and overlapping communities with different degrees of diversity.

ABSTRACT: background_label: Cultural proximity is a multidimensional concept, most often used to explain media preferences across national boundaries.
objective_label: The present study extends the construct, revealing its power to explain audience formation within a multicultural society.
method_label: Portable People Meter data from Arbitron, Inc., was used to compare patterns of television and radio use across Spanish-speaking Hispanics, English-speaking Hispanics, and non-Hispanics in Houston, Texas.
result_label: The results indicate that language preferences play a powerful role in determining audience behavior.
result_label: Furthermore, while English-speaking Hispanics exhibit multicultural fluency, the other two populations show evidence of cultural polarization.

TITLE: Structure of the parasitoid communities of grass-feeding chalcid wasps
ABSTRACT: background_label: The parasitoid assemblages associated with 18 species of chalcid wasps feeding on 10 grass species were sampled quantitatively between 1980 and 1992 at 24 sites in Wales and England to examine food web structure, the size and composition of the parasitoid complexes, and structures of the local communities.
background_label: The complete food web included 87 species organized into five trophic levels.
background_label: The lower two consumer trophic levels (the herbivores and primary parasitoids) were characterized by extreme host specificity, whereas the top two trophic levels (hyperparasitoids and tertiary parasitoids) comprised more generalized omnivores.
background_label: The high levels of specialization resulted in a compartmentalized web.
background_label: The regional species richness of the parasitoid complexes associated with Tetramesa species (Eurytomidae) depends primarily on measures of host abundance.
result_label: Total species richness was significantly positively correlated with mean log host density (number per m 2 ) and the number of larvae per grass stem, explaining 70.5% of the variance in richness.
result_label: Similarly, the number of specialist parasitoids was correlated with host density, whereas generalist species richness was most strongly correlated with host density and more weakly with host gall-formation and voltinism.
result_label: The only determinant of local parasitoid species richness is regional richness (the latter explained 97.3% of the variance in the former).
background_label: Further, there was no β-diversity in this food web, and every species found on a host species in Britain is found in virtually every local host population.
background_label: The relatively few cases where fewer parasitoid species were found represent undersampling at particular sites.
background_label: Limited evidence indicates that similar results apply to host populations on continental Europe.
background_label: Thus, there is no evidence that the richness of local communities is constrained by species interactions.
background_label: Variation in parasitism rates both between and within host species cannot be explained by the available variables, so the forces affecting host utilization rates remain unknown.
result_label: We found that the formation of a gall had no influence on host mortality rates, offering no support for the hypothesis that galling provides protection from parasitoids.
result_label: The parasitoids of most host species have consistent relative abundances over time and space.
result_label: We could not identify any ecological correlates of the degree of consistency, but it may be due to the extremely widespread occurrence of all of the parasitoids coupled with their innate host-finding abilities.

TITLE: The effect of ethnic diversity and community disadvantage on social cohesion: A multi-level analysis of social capital and interethnic relations in UK communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: A number of studies have found a negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social capital and assumed from this a harmful effect of diversity on social cohesion.
background_label: This article suggests that social cohesion must be treated as a multifaceted concept and any analysis into the relationship between diversity and social capital needs to be complemented by an analysis of diversity?s effect on ?relations between ethnic groups?.
result_label: Our results show that while increasing diversity does have a negative impact on social capital, it simultaneously improves perceptions of, and relations between, ethnic groups.
method_label: Furthermore, we find that forming ?bridging?
result_label: ties in diverse environments plays a significant role in the positive relationship between diversity and tolerance, and that the presence of ?bridging?
result_label: ties can also reduce the negative impact of diversity on social capital.
result_label: However, while our results show that diversity has both positive and negative effects on social cohesion, we find that it is disadvantage which has the most detrimental impact, undermining both social capital and interethnic relations.
result_label: We also find evidence that using a more sensitive measure of diversity (creating an area typology based on the proportional size, number, and type of ethnic groups in an area) reveals that living in different structures of diversity may lead to different social cohesion outcomes.

TITLE: Mixed-initiative social media analytics at the World Bank: Observations of citizen sentiment in Twitter data to explore "trust" of political actors and state institutions and its relationship to social protest
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper discusses a project that studied the relationship between citizen trust and social protest using visual analysis of approximately 11 million sentiment classified Tweets from the period of the 2014 Brazilian World Cup.
background_label: The results of the study reveal that the 2014 World Cup protests in Brazil sprang from a wide range of grievances coupled with a relative sense of deprivation compared with emergent comparative `standards'.
method_label: This sense of grievance gave rise to sentiments that activated online protest that may have led to other forms of social protest, such as demonstrations.
result_label: The paper describes an innovative approach to big data analytics-mixed initiative social media analytics - and discusses the potential of using big data in social science research of this kind, as well as some of the open methodological, technical and ethical issues still to be addressed.

TITLE: Scalable community discovery on textual data with relations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Every piece of textual data is generated as a method to convey its authors' opinion regarding specific topics.
background_label: Authors deliberately organize their writings and create links, i.e., references, acknowledgments, for better expression.
background_label: Thereafter, it is of interest to study texts as well as their relations to understand the underlying topics and communities.
background_label: Although many efforts exist in the literature in data clustering and topic mining, they are not applicable to community discovery on large document corpus for several reasons.
method_label: First, few of them consider both textual attributes as well as relations.
result_label: Second, scalability remains a significant issue for large-scale datasets.
background_label: Additionally, most algorithms rely on a set of initial parameters that are hard to be captured and tuned.
background_label: Motivated by the aforementioned observations, a hierarchical community model is proposed in the paper which distinguishes community cores from affiliated members.
objective_label: We present our efforts to develop a scalable community discovery solution for large-scale document corpus.
objective_label: Our proposal tries to quickly identify potential cores as seeds of communities through relation analysis.
method_label: To eliminate the influence of initial parameters, an innovative attribute-based core merge process is introduced so that the algorithm promises to return consistent communities regardless initial parameters.
result_label: Experimental results suggest that the proposed method has high scalability to corpus size and feature dimensionality, with more than 15 topical precision improvement compared with popular clustering techniques.

TITLE: A Survey of Topic Modeling in Text Mining
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic models provide a convenient way to analyze large of unclassified text.
background_label: A topic contains a cluster of words that frequently occur together.
background_label: A topic modeling can connect words with similar meanings and distinguish between uses of words with multiple meanings.
objective_label: This paper provides two categories that can be under the field of topic modeling.
method_label: First one discusses the area of methods of topic modeling, which has four methods that can be considerable under this category.
method_label: These methods are Latent semantic analysis (LSA), Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and Correlated topic model (CTM).
method_label: The second category is called topic evolution models, which model topics by considering an important factor time.
result_label: In the second category, different models are discussed, such as topic over time (TOT), dynamic topic models (DTM), multiscale topic tomography, dynamic topic correlation detection, detecting topic evolution in scientific literature, etc.

TITLE: Content+Context=Classification: Examining the Roles of Social Interactions and Linguist Content in Twitter User Classification
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractTwitter users demonstrate many characteristics via their online presence.
background_label: Connections, community memberships, and communication patterns reveal both idiosyncratic and general properties of users.
background_label: In addition, the content of tweets can be critical for distinguishing the role and importance of a user.
objective_label: In this work, we explore Twitter user classification using context and content cues.
method_label: We construct a rich graph structure induced by hashtags and social communications in Twitter.
background_label: We derive features from this graph structure-centrality, communities, and local flow of information.
method_label: In addition, we perform detailed content analysis on tweets looking at offensiveness and topics.
method_label: We then examine user classification and the role of feature types (context, content) and learning methods (propositional, relational) through a series of experiments on annotated data.
method_label: Our work contrasts with prior approaches in that we use relational learning and alternative, non-specialized feature sets.
objective_label: Our goal is to understand how both content and context are predictive of user characteristics.
result_label: Experiments demonstrate that the best performance for user classification uses relational learning with varying content and context features.

TITLE: Automatic online news topic ranking using media focus and user attention based on aging theory
ABSTRACT: background_label: News topics, which are constructed from news stories using the techniques of Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT), bring convenience to users who intend to see what is going on through the Internet.
background_label: However, it is almost impossible to view all the generated topics, because of the large amount.
background_label: So it will be helpful if all topics are ranked and the top ones, which are both timely and important, can be viewed with high priority.
method_label: Generally, topic ranking is determined by two primary factors.
method_label: One is how frequently and recently a topic is reported by the media; the other is how much attention users pay to it.
result_label: Both media focus and user attention varies as time goes on, so the effect of time on topic ranking has already been included.
background_label: However, inconsistency exists between both factors.
objective_label: In this paper, an automatic online news topic ranking algorithm is proposed based on inconsistency analysis between media focus and user attention.
method_label: News stories are organized into topics, which are ranked in terms of both media focus and user attention.
method_label: Experiments performed on practical Web datasets show that the topic ranking result reflects the influence of time, the media and users.
objective_label: The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
method_label: First, we present the quantitative measure of the inconsistency between media focus and user attention, which provides a basis for topic ranking and an experimental evidence to show that there is a gap between what the media provide and what users view.
result_label: Second, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to synthesize the two factors into one algorithm for automatic online topic ranking.

TITLE: Fluid Communities: A Community Detection Algorithm
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractCommunity detection algorithms are a family of unsupervised graph mining algorithms which group vertices into clusters (i.e., communities).
background_label: These algorithms provide insight into both the structure of a network and the entities that compose it.
objective_label: In this paper we propose a novel community detection algorithm based on the simple idea of fluids interacting in an environment, expanding and contracting.
method_label: The fluid communities algorithm is based on the efficient propagation method, which makes it very competitive in computational cost and scalability.
method_label: At the same time, the quality of its results is close to that of current state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.
method_label: An interesting novelty of the fluid communities algorithm is that it is the first propagation-based method capable of identifying a variable number of communities within a graph.

TITLE: The social and economic bases of network multiplexity: Exploring the emergence of multiplex ties
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The goal of this article is to shed light on the role of tie content in the evolution of multiplex ties – i.e., ties featuring both an economic and a social component – in interorganizational networks.
method_label: The authors clarify and extend the theoretical framework on network multiplexity by testing the extent to which two distinct tie content-related logics – social interaction and economic exchange – and their underlying mechanisms lead to the emergence of multiplex ties.
result_label: Results from a longitudinal network analysis of firms located in an Italian multimedia cluster support the authors’ hypotheses, confirming that both social and economic drivers contribute to the emergence of network multiplexity, and that social ties have a stronger impact than economic ties on this process, thus providing further insight into the microdynamics of network evolution.

TITLE: Uncorrelated Feature Encoding for Faster Image Style Transfer
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent fast style transfer methods use a pre-trained convolutional neural network as a feature encoder and a perceptual loss network.
background_label: Although the pre-trained network is used to generate responses of receptive fields effective for representing style and content of image, it is not optimized for image style transfer but rather for image classification.
background_label: Furthermore, it also requires a time-consuming and correlation-considering feature alignment process for image style transfer because of its inter-channel correlation.
method_label: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning method which optimizes an encoder/decoder network for the purpose of style transfer as well as relieves the feature alignment complexity from considering inter-channel correlation.
method_label: We used uncorrelation loss, i.e., the total correlation coefficient between the responses of different encoder channels, with style and content losses for training style transfer network.
method_label: This makes the encoder network to be trained to generate inter-channel uncorrelated features and to be optimized for the task of image style transfer which maintained the quality of image style only with a light-weighted and correlation-unaware feature alignment process.
method_label: Moreover, our method drastically reduced redundant channels of the encoded feature and this resulted in the efficient size of structure of network and faster forward processing speed.
result_label: Our method can also be applied to cascade network scheme for multiple scaled style transferring and allows user-control of style strength by using a content-style trade-off parameter.

TITLE: Detecting community structure in complex networks via node similarity
ABSTRACT: background_label: The detection of the community structure in networks is beneficial to understand the network structure and to analyze the network properties.
method_label: Based on node similarity, a fast and efficient method for detecting community structure is proposed, which discovers the community structure by iteratively incorporating the community containing a node with the communities that contain the nodes with maximum similarity to this node to form a new community.
method_label: The presented method has low computational complexity because of requiring only the local information of the network, and it does not need any prior knowledge about the communities and its detection results are robust on the selection of the initial node.
method_label: Some real-world and computer-generated networks are used to evaluate the performance of the presented method.
result_label: The simulation results demonstrate that this method is efficient to detect community structure in complex networks, and the ZLZ metrics used in the proposed method is the most suitable one among local indices in community detection.

TITLE: Exploring the relationship between language change and dictionary: compilation in the age of the collaborative dictionary
ABSTRACT: background_label: The rise in collaborative "wiki" dictionaries means that dictionary creation is no longer the purview solely of academics and publishing companies.
background_label: Ordinary people can now create and share their own dictionary entries, whilst traditional publishing houses must compete against resources able to achieve levels of interactivity and immediacy that they simply cannot.
background_label: These differences in the dictionary landscape may not be the only consequence of the rise of "wiki" dictionaries, however; the very relationship between dictionary compilation and language change may be shifting, with the speed and ease of updating of "wiki" dictionaries meaning that they not only reflect current use, but actually drive change.
objective_label: This paper examines the possibility of this, through the findings of a pilot study featuring a new web-based corpus of youth neologisms, and media tracking of these new words.
result_label: In it, I set out to determine the relationship between the Wiktionary definition and the grassroots use of particular words, as well as considering if and how this is changing as "wiki" dictionaries become more and more firmly established.

TITLE: The author-recipient-topic model for topic and role discovery in social networks: Experiments with Enron and academic email
ABSTRACT: background_label: Previous work in social network analysis (SNA) has modeled the existence of links from one entity to another, but not the language content or topics on those links.
method_label: We present the Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) model for social network analysis, which learns topic distributions based on the the directionsensitive messages sent between entities.
method_label: The model builds on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and the Author-Topic (AT) model, adding the key attribute that distribution over topics is conditioned distinctly on both the sender and recipient—steering the discovery of topics according to the relationships between people.
result_label: We give results on both the Enron email corpus and a researcher’s email archive, providing evidence not only that clearly relevant topics are discovered, but that the ART model better predicts people’s roles.

TITLE: The contingent nature of brain gain and brain circulation: their foreign context and the impact of return scientists on the scientific community in their country of origin
ABSTRACT: background_label: The recent literature on high skilled labor migration has taken a turn from analyzing processes of ‘brain drain’ to processes of ‘brain gain’ and ‘brain circulation’.
background_label: Returning scientists, having been affiliated to foreign institutes, are able to facilitate knowledge exchanges between the two locations, and facilitate the linkage of the national scientific community to international scientific cooperation projects.
background_label: In this way, return scientists can have a disproportionate impact on the development of the scientific community in their country of origin.
background_label: However, not all flows of return migrants have had such a positive impact.
background_label: Returnees failed to affect developments in some localities, while producing ambiguous effects in others.
background_label: These studies typically argue that the impact of return migrants is dependent on the absorptive capacity and the local social, cultural, and institutional context in the country of origin.
objective_label: Using data on return migrants within the Taiwanese economic academic community, this paper seeks to add to this literature by arguing that the impact of return migrants is not only dependent on the circumstances in their country of origin, but is also contingent on the nature and quality of the context in which they acquired their international labor experience.
result_label: Skills and access to knowledge networks are heterogeneously spread over geographical space, so that the context in which a return migrant acquired his or her international labor experience matters.

TITLE: Totalitarian Language: Orwell's Newspeak and Its Nazi and Communist Antecedents
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this analysis of the language of totalitarianism, John Wesley Young examines the manipulation of language by Nazi and Communist regimes.
background_label: Relating the language of totalitarian regimes to the language Newspeak in George Orwell's satirical novel "1984", Young addresses the similarities and differences between the real and fictional languages, demonstrates the accuracy of Newspeak, and explores the degree of control that language can exert over the thought and behaviour of a people.
background_label: Based on Orwell's own perceptions of political, literary and linguistic practices, Newspeak is used in the novel by a totalitarian dictatorship to create a distorted view of reality and to control the thought and behaviour of its subjects.
background_label: It is a language in which heretical ideas cannot be expressed or even concieved.
method_label: Young's analysis of the speeches and writings of actual dictators, particularly in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, reveals a similar propagandistic structure in the use, or misuse, of language, the purpose of which was to enslave and control the populace.
result_label: Young's analysis of the effects of these languages on the subjects of totalitarian dictatorships reveals that although Orwell's Newspeak was a potent instrument of control over the thought and behaviour of the citizens, the language of actual totalitarian regimes was not nearly so successful.
result_label: When official rhetoric and reality did not agree, the skepticism and cynicism of the people gave rise to the phenomenon of counterlanguages that attempted to reinscribe the reality of life under dictorial rule.
result_label: Young evaluates the extent to which thought control succeeded under the Nazi and Soviet regimes and considers the implications that these findings offer for linguistic determinism.

TITLE: What’s with the Attitude? Identifying Sentences with Attitude in Online Discussions
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractMining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing.
background_label: An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web.
background_label: Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums.
background_label: Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics.
method_label: In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another.
method_label: This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative.
method_label: This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links.
method_label: The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts.
result_label: The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.

TITLE: Hierarchical Re-estimation of Topic Models for Measuring Topical Diversity
ABSTRACT: background_label: A high degree of topical diversity is often considered to be an important characteristic of interesting text documents.
background_label: A recent proposal for measuring topical diversity identifies three elements for assessing diversity: words, topics, and documents as collections of words.
background_label: Topic models play a central role in this approach.
method_label: Using standard topic models for measuring diversity of documents is suboptimal due to generality and impurity.
method_label: General topics only include common information from a background corpus and are assigned to most of the documents in the collection.
method_label: Impure topics contain words that are not related to the topic; impurity lowers the interpretability of topic models and impure topics are likely to get assigned to documents erroneously.
method_label: We propose a hierarchical re-estimation approach for topic models to combat generality and impurity; the proposed approach operates at three levels: words, topics, and documents.
result_label: Our re-estimation approach for measuring documents' topical diversity outperforms the state of the art on PubMed dataset which is commonly used for diversity experiments.

TITLE: Subspace Based Network Community Detection Using Sparse Linear Coding
ABSTRACT: background_label: Information mining from networks by identifying communities is an important problem across a number of research fields including social science, biology, physics, and medicine.
background_label: Most existing community detection algorithms are graph theoretic and lack the ability to detect accurate community boundaries if the ratio of intra-community to inter-community links is low.
background_label: Also, algorithms based on modularity maximization may fail to resolve communities smaller than a specific size if the community size varies significantly.
method_label: In this paper, we present a fundamentally different community detection algorithm based on the fact that each network community spans a different subspace in the geodesic space.
method_label: Therefore, each node can only be efficiently represented as a linear combination of nodes spanning the same subspace.
method_label: To make the process of community detection more robust, we use sparse linear coding with l1 norm constraint.
method_label: In order to find a community label for each node, sparse spectral clustering algorithm is used.
method_label: The proposed community detection technique is compared with more than 10 state of the art methods on two benchmark networks (with known clusters) using normalized mutual information criterion.
result_label: Our proposed algorithm outperformed existing algorithms with a significant margin on both benchmark networks.
result_label: The proposed algorithm has also shown excellent performance on three real-world networks.

TITLE: Quantifying Controversy in Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Which topics spark the most heated debates on social media?
background_label: Identifying those topics is not only interesting from a societal point of view, but also allows the filtering and aggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories.
objective_label: In this paper, we perform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content and the network structure of social media.
method_label: Unlike previous work, rather than study controversy in a single hand-picked topic and use domain specific knowledge, we take a general approach to study topics in any domain.
method_label: Our approach to quantifying controversy is based on a graph-based three-stage pipeline, which involves (i) building a conversation graph about a topic; (ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of the controversy; and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the graph.
method_label: We perform an extensive comparison of controversy measures, different graph-building approaches, and data sources.
method_label: We use both controversial and non-controversial topics on Twitter, as well as other external datasets.
result_label: We find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in capturing the intuitive notion of controversy, and show that content features are vastly less helpful in this task.

TITLE: Using the web to support political analysis: identifying legislative bill ideology in the chilean parliament
ABSTRACT: background_label: In this work we propose a Web-centric approach for estimating legislative bill tendency.
background_label: Our main assumption is that the current state of the Web represents a complex system that reflects human thinking and behavior.
background_label: Today's Web services are characterized by user generated content, allowing everyone to interact and share their view about almost any topic, in the form of posts, comments, reviews, etc.
method_label: If that data is extracted and efficiently aggregated, it could be possible to obtain a general estimation or view of a given phenomenon or event.
method_label: We perform semi supervised classification of legislative bill by generating vector representations using three methods, Term Frequency vectors, Topic Models and Word Embeddings with the goal of estimating the tendency of a bill to favor corporations and industries over common good.
result_label: The output, which can be seen as an estimation of the ideology of a bill, is then used to support political analysis, specifically, to study the relationship between campaign funding and voting behavior.

TITLE: Topic Lifecycle on Social Networks: Analyzing the Effects of Semantic Continuity and Social Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic lifecycle analysis on Twitter, a branch of study that investigates Twitter topics from their birth through lifecycle to death, has gained immense mainstream research popularity.
background_label: In the literature, topics are often treated as one of (a) hashtags (independent from other hashtags), (b) a burst of keywords in a short time span or (c) a latent concept space captured by advanced text analysis methodologies, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
background_label: The first two approaches are not capable of recognizing topics where different users use different hashtags to express the same concept (semantically related), while the third approach misses out the user's explicit intent expressed via hashtags.
method_label: In our work, we use a word embedding based approach to cluster different hashtags together, and the temporal concurrency of the hashtag usages, thus forming topics (a semantically and temporally related group of hashtags).We present a novel analysis of topic lifecycles with respect to communities.
method_label: We characterize the participation of social communities in the topic clusters, and analyze the lifecycle of topic clusters with respect to such participation.
method_label: We derive first-of-its-kind novel insights with respect to the complex evolution of topics over communities and time: temporal morphing of topics over hashtags within communities, how the hashtags die in some communities but morph into some other hashtags in some other communities (that, it is a community-level phenomenon), and how specific communities adopt to specific hashtags.
result_label: Our work is fundamental in the space of topic lifecycle modeling and understanding in communities: it redefines our understanding of topic lifecycles and shows that the social boundaries of topic lifecycles are deeply ingrained with community behavior.

TITLE: Mixtures of hierarchical topics with Pachinko allocation
ABSTRACT: background_label: The four-level pachinko allocation model (PAM) (Li & McCallum, 2006) represents correlations among topics using a DAG structure.
background_label: It does not, however, represent a nested hierarchy of topics, with some topical word distributions representing the vocabulary that is shared among several more specific topics.
objective_label: This paper presents hierarchical PAM---an enhancement that explicitly represents a topic hierarchy.
method_label: This model can be seen as combining the advantages of hLDA's topical hierarchy representation with PAM's ability to mix multiple leaves of the topic hierarchy.
result_label: Experimental results show improvements in likelihood of held-out documents, as well as mutual information between automatically-discovered topics and humangenerated categories such as journals.

TITLE: Conversation Trees: A Grammar Model for Topic Structure in Forums
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online forum discussions proceed differently from face-to-face conversations and any single thread on an online forum contains posts on different subtopics.
objective_label: This work aims to characterize the content of a forum thread as a conversation tree of topics.
method_label: We present models that jointly perform two tasks: segment a thread into subparts, and assign a topic to each part.
method_label: Our core idea is a definition of topic structure using probabilistic grammars.
method_label: By leveraging the flexibility of two grammar formalisms, Context-Free Grammars and Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems, our models create desirable structures for forum threads: our topic segmentation is hierarchical, links non-adjacent segments on the same topic, and jointly labels the topic during segmentation.
result_label: We show that our models outperform a number of tree generation baselines.

TITLE: Tracking dynamics of topic trends using a finite mixture model
ABSTRACT: background_label: In a wide range of business areas dealing with text data streams, including CRM, knowledge management, and Web monitoring services, it is an important issue to discover topic trends and analyze their dynamics in real-time.
background_label: Specifically we consider the following three tasks in topic trend analysis: 1)Topic Structure Identification; identifying what kinds of main topics exist and how important they are, 2)Topic Emergence Detection; detecting the emergence of a new topic and recognizing how it grows, 3)Topic Characterization; identifying the characteristics for each of main topics.
background_label: For real topic analysis systems, we may require that these three tasks be performed in an on-line fashion rather than in a retrospective way, and be dealt with in a single framework.
method_label: This paper proposes a new topic analysis framework which satisfies this requirement from a unifying viewpoint that a topic structure is modeled using a finite mixture model and that any change of a topic trend is tracked by learning the finite mixture model dynamically.
method_label: In this framework we propose the usage of a time-stamp based discounting learning algorithm in order to realize real-time topic structure identification.
method_label: This enables tracking the topic structure adaptively by forgetting out-of-date statistics.
method_label: Further we apply the theory of dynamic model selection to detecting changes of main components in the finite mixture model in order to realize topic emergence detection.
result_label: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using real data collected at a help desk to show that we are able to track dynamics of topic trends in a timely fashion.

TITLE: The surface EEG in relation to its sources
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract We have presented a mathematical model to demonstrate the attenuating effects of a shell of different conductivity on the potentials produced by a single dipole located in a homogeneous conducting sphere.
background_label: In the monkey, recordings of evoked responses to clicks can be interpreted as showing attenuating and “smearing” effects of the various layers that overlie the cortex.
result_label: In agreement with the mathematical model, highly conducting layers show the greatest attenuating effects.
result_label: Responses which were recorded from only a small area of exposed pial surface were especially affected and were, for all practical purposes, not detectable through the overlying layers.

TITLE: Author-level metrics in the new academic profile platforms: The online behaviour of the Bibliometrics community
ABSTRACT: background_label: The new web-based academic communication platforms do not only enable researchers to better advertise their academic outputs, making them more visible than ever before, but they also provide a wide supply of metrics to help authors better understand the impact their work is making.
objective_label: This study has three objectives: a) to analyse the uptake of some of the most popular platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley and Twitter) by a specific scientific community (bibliometrics, scientometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and altmetrics); b) to compare the metrics available from each platform; and c) to determine the meaning of all these new metrics.
method_label: To do this, the data available in these platforms about a sample of 811 authors (researchers in bibliometrics for whom a public profile Google Scholar Citations was found) were extracted.
method_label: A total of 31 metrics were analysed.
result_label: The results show that a high number of the analysed researchers only had a profile in Google Scholar Citations (159), or only in Google Scholar Citations and ResearchGate (142).
result_label: Lastly, we find two kinds of metrics of online impact.
result_label: First, metrics related to connectivity (followers), and second, all metrics associated to academic impact.
method_label: This second group can further be divided into usage metrics (reads, views), and citation metrics.
result_label: The results suggest that Google Scholar Citations is the source that provides more comprehensive citation-related data, whereas Twitter stands out in connectivity-related metrics.

TITLE: Sexing the Internet: Reflections on the Role of Identification in Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article addresses how demographic profiling in online forums affects the creation of socially vibrant communities.
background_label: Many site designers, believing that user profiles aid in community development by providing the users with a social context, encourage or require their use.
background_label: Instead of offering a broader context for users to grasp the social cues normally available in the physical world, profiles dramatically affect the social behaviors, norms and cultures of online environments, most notably at the expense of le ss privileged groups.
method_label: I analyze the impact of systematically created profiles in online environments.
method_label: In doing so, i discuss how the coarse categorizations of age, sex and location (A/S/L) – the standard formulation of identity online – do not necessarily provide deeper intuition for individuals and how the information desired alters social norms, specifically magnifying socially problematic stereotypes and automatically sexualizing the environment.
method_label: In particular, i am interested in the ways that the use of ‘sex’ as a marker of identity has created a rigid set of social classifications online.
result_label: I argue that the use of gender, in place of ‘sex’ would offer online participants a more fluid set of identity markers.

TITLE: Collaboration amidst disagreement and moral judgment: The dynamics of Jewish and Arab students’ collaborative inquiry of their joint past
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present an instructional model involving a computer-supported collaborative learning environment, in which students from two conflicting groups collaboratively investigate an event relevant to their past using historical texts.
background_label: We traced one enactment of the model by a group comprised of two Israeli Jewish and two Israeli Arab students.
method_label: Our data sources included the texts participants wrote—pre-, post- and during the activity, jointly and individually—the transcripts of the e-discussion and reflections written after the activity.
method_label: The setting enabled us to further our understanding of what collaboration means when students’ voices do not converge.
method_label: We examined whether the activity was productive in terms of learning, and the dynamics of collaboration within the milieu, especially the intersubjective meaning making.
method_label: The e-discussion that was co-constructed by participants was a chain of disagreements.
result_label: However, participants’ reflections reveal that the group structure and the e-communication method were perceived as affording sensitive collaboration.
result_label: Furthermore, a comparison between the individual texts, pre- and post- the group discussion, revealed that the activity was productive, since students moved from a one-sided presentation of the event to a more multi-sided representation.
result_label: Based on the analysis of the e-discussion, we conclude that the setting provided students with opportunities to examine their voices in light of alternatives.
result_label: We propose the term fission to articulate certain moments of intersubjectivity, where a crack is formed in one’s voice as the Other’s voice impacts it, and one’s voice become more polyphonic.

TITLE: A Microphotonic Astrocomb
ABSTRACT: background_label: One of the essential prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers.
background_label: It has already been realized that the large number of exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as calibration light sources.
background_label: A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers.
method_label: Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23.7 GHz.
method_label: This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer.
result_label: As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research.

TITLE: Topic Modeling Using Distributed Word Embeddings
ABSTRACT: objective_label: We propose a new algorithm for topic modeling, Vec2Topic, that identifies the main topics in a corpus using semantic information captured via high-dimensional distributed word embeddings.
method_label: Our technique is unsupervised and generates a list of topics ranked with respect to importance.
method_label: We find that it works better than existing topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation for identifying key topics in user-generated content, such as emails, chats, etc., where topics are diffused across the corpus.
result_label: We also find that Vec2Topic works equally well for non-user generated content, such as papers, reports, etc., and for small corpora such as a single-document.

TITLE: Discovering Coherent Topics with Entity Topic Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Probabilistic topic models are powerful techniques which are widely used for discovering topics or semantic content from a large collection of documents.
background_label: However, because topic models are entirely unsupervised, they may lead to topics that are not understandable in applications.
background_label: Recently, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed which primarily use word-level domain knowledge in the model to enhance the topic coherence and ignore the rich information carried by entities (e.g persons, location, organizations, etc.)
background_label: associated with the documents.
background_label: Additionally, there exists a vast amount of prior knowledge (background knowledge) represented as ontologies and Linked Open Data (LOD), which can be incorporated into the topic models to produce coherent topics.
method_label: In this paper, we introduce a novel entity-based topic model, called EntLDA, to effectively integrate an ontology with an entity topic model to improve the topic modeling process.
method_label: Furthermore, to increase the coherence of the identified topics, we introduce a novel ontology-based regularization framework, which is then integrated with the EntLDA model.
result_label: Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in improving the coherence of the topics.

TITLE: Trolling the trolls: Online forum users constructions of the nature and properties of trolling
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract'Trolling' refers to a specific type of malicious online behaviour, intended to disrupt interactions, aggravate interactional partners and lure them into fruitless argumentation.
objective_label: However, as with other categories, both 'troll' and 'trolling' may have multiple, inconsistent and incompatible meanings, depending upon the context in which the term is used and the aims of the person using the term.Drawing data from 15 online fora and newspaper comment threads, this paper explores how online users mobilise and make use of the term 'troll'.
method_label: Data was analysed from a discursive psychological perspective.Four repertoires describing trolls were identified in posters online messages: 1) that trolls are easily identifiable, 2) nostalgia, 3) vigilantism and 4) that trolls are nasty.
method_label: A final theme follows these repertoires -that of identifying trolls.
result_label: Analysis also revealed that despite repertoire 01, identifying trolls is not a simple and straight-forward task.Similarly to any other rhetorical category, there are tensions inherent in posters accounts of nature and acceptability of trolling.
result_label: Neither the category 'troll' nor the action of 'trolling' has a single, fixed meaning.
result_label: Either action may be presented as desirable or undesirable, depending upon the aims of the poster at the time of posting.

TITLE: The Impact of Anonymity in Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: The scale of participation on social news sites has challenged community managers, leaving them unable to detect and remove all inappropriate content by hand.
background_label: Automated insult and profanity detection systems have helped, but have failed to address the problem of why this content is contributed in the first place.
background_label: That is, what implications do interface design choices have on the content being generated?
background_label: One such design choice is whether or not a site allows anonymous comments.
objective_label: What impact does allowing anonymity have on the quality or quantity of participation on a site?
other_label: This case study analyses the impact of anonymity on a technology social news site, TechCrunch.com.
method_label: TechCrunch is ideal for this study in that it underwent a shift from allowing anonymous comments (using the Disqus commenting platform) to disallowing them (using the Facebook commenting platform) in March of 2011.
method_label: We compare the quality of anonymous and real identity comments through measures of reading level, relevance to the target article, negativity and presence of swear words and anger words.
result_label: We couple this qualitative analysis with a quantitative analysis of the change in participation to give a complete picture of the impact of anonymity in this online community, with the end goal of informing design on similar social news sites.

TITLE: Extracting topics based on authors, recipients and content in microblogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Microblogs such as Twitter are important sources for spreading vital information at high speed.
background_label: They also reflect the general people's reaction and opinion towards major events or stories.
background_label: With information traveling so quickly, it is helpful to be able to apply unsupervised learning techniques to discover topics for information extraction and analysis.
background_label: Although graphical models have been traditionally used for topic discovery in microblogs and text streams, previous work may not be as efficient because of the diverse and noisy nature of microblogs.
method_label: In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the Author-Topic and the Author-Recipient-Topic model to microblogs.
method_label: We extensively compare these models under different settings to an LDA baseline.
result_label: Our results show that the Author-Recipient-Topic model extracts the most coherent topics establishing that joint modeling on author-recipient pairs and on the content of tweet leads to quantitatively better topic discovery.
result_label: This paper also addresses the problem of topic modeling on short text by using clustering techniques.
result_label: This technique helps in boosting the performance of our models.
result_label: Our study reveals interesting traits about Twitter messages, users and their interactions.

TITLE: Topic and Role Discovery in Social Networks with Experiments on Enron and Academic Email
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractPrevious work in social network analysis (SNA) has modeled the existence of links from one entity to another, but not the attributes such as language content or topics on those links.
method_label: We present the Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) model for social network analysis, which learns topic distributions based on the direction-sensitive messages sent between entities.
method_label: The model builds on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the AuthorTopic (AT) model, adding the key attribute that distribution over topics is conditioned distinctly on both the sender and recipient-steering the discovery of topics according to the relationships between people.
result_label: We give results on both the Enron email corpus and a researcher's email archive, providing evidence not only that clearly relevant topics are discovered, but that the ART model better predicts people's roles and gives lower perplexity on previously unseen messages.
result_label: We also present the Role-Author-Recipient-Topic (RART) model, an extension to ART that explicitly represents people's roles.

method_label: First, we adapt the PLSA-SIM algorithm to the more widespread LDA model and ngrams.
method_label: Then we propose a novel algorithm LDA-ITER that allows the incorporation of the most suitable ngrams into topic models.
result_label: The experiments of integrating ngrams and multiword terms conducted on five text collections in different languages and domains demonstrate a significant improvement in all the metrics under consideration.

TITLE: Online community search using conversational structures
ABSTRACT: background_label: Online communities are valuable information sources where knowledge is accumulated by interactions between people.
background_label: Search services provided by online community sites such as forums are often, however, quite poor.
method_label: To address this, we investigate retrieval techniques that exploit the hierarchical thread structures in community sites.
method_label: Since these structures are sometimes not explicit or accurately annotated, we introduce structure discovery techniques that use a variety of features to model relations between posts.
method_label: We then make use of thread structures in retrieval experiments with two online forums and one email archive.
result_label: Our results show that using thread structures that have been accurately annotated can lead to significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to strong baselines.

TITLE: Characterizing the community structure of complex networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Community structure is one of the key properties of complex networks and plays a crucial role in their topology and function.
background_label: While an impressive amount of work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of communities in real networks.
objective_label: We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical properties of communities in large information, communication, technological, biological, and social networks.
method_label: We find that the mesoscopic organization of networks of the same category is remarkably similar.
method_label: This is reflected in several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as ``fingerprints'' of specific network categories.
method_label: While community size distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules.
method_label: Average path lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size, but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a characteristic size.
method_label: This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within communities, whose roles differ across categories.
result_label: Also the community embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category.
result_label: Our findings are verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection methods.

TITLE: Drift in Online Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: The digital world has opened up a new realm of involvement for people from ages eight to eighty.
background_label: Online social media and news articles are both vital parts of the modern digital world, where users tend to spend most of their time.
background_label: Users post comments in online social platforms on various topics and create user engagement through discussions and conversations with other users on a topic in the online platform.
background_label: User engagement is one of the most important revenue factors of online publishing houses.
background_label: But, discussion and conversational flow of the topic tends to change and even drift to out-of-topic contexts as different users post in these social platforms.
background_label: Topic drift can have a significant effect on future user engagement in terms of ‘comments' or ‘likes' and subsequently the revenue metric.
result_label: In one direction, topic drift towards a totally different area may significantly reduce future user engagement on that article but on the other hand topic drift towards any ‘controversial’ or ‘hot’ topic in that particular time frame can increase future engagement.
result_label: Thus topic drift is an important phenomena in the online world.
objective_label: In this paper, our aim is to identify how topic flow changes and explore the various characteristics of topic drift and user behavior in online forums.

TITLE: Characterizing and Predicting the Popularity of Online Videos
ABSTRACT: background_label: A huge amount of video content has been generated on the Internet, and user attention among those videos is allocated in an asymmetric way, with the vast majority barely noticed while a few of videos become very popular.
background_label: Hence, understanding the popularity characteristics of online videos and predicting the future popularity of individual videos are of great importance.
background_label: They have direct implications in various contexts, such as service design, advertisement planning, network management, and so on.
objective_label: In this paper, we address those two problems head-on based on data collected from a leading online video service provider in China, namely Youku.
method_label: We firstly analyze the characteristics of Youku video popularity from four key aspects: long-term popularity, video lifetime, popularity evolution pattern, and early stage popularity.
method_label: Then, we undertake the challenge of future popularity prediction, by proposing a model that can capture the popularity dynamics based on early popularity evolution pattern and future popularity burst prediction.
result_label: The approach is validated on exhaustive real-world data and achieves significant decreases in relative prediction errors, reaching up to 32.73% and 11.28% reductions over two state-of-the-art baseline models, respectively.
result_label: At last, we also provide the potential and limitation analysis of model parameters in practice.

TITLE: Dark Web portal overlapping community detection based on topic models
ABSTRACT: background_label: A hot research topic is the study and monitoring of online communities.
background_label: Of course, homeland security institutions from many countries are using data mining techniques to perform this task, aiming to anticipate and avoid a possible menace to local peace.
background_label: Tools such as social networks analysis and text mining have contributed to the understanding of these kinds of groups in order to develop counter-terrorism applications.
method_label: A key application is the discovery of sub-communities of interests which main topic could be a possible homeland security threat.
method_label: However, most algorithms detect disjoint communities, which means that every community member belongs to a single community.
method_label: Thus, final conclusions can be omitting valuable information which leads to wrong results interpretations.
method_label: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine traditional network analysis methods for overlapping community detection with topic-model based text mining techniques.
method_label: Afterwards, we developed a sub-community detection algorithm that allow each member belong more than one sub-community.
result_label: Experiments were performed using an English language based forum available in the Dark Web portal (islamicAwakening).

TITLE: Discovering Communities of Community Discovery
ABSTRACT: background_label: Discovering communities in complex networks means grouping nodes similar to each other, to uncover latent information about them.
background_label: There are hundreds of different algorithms to solve the community detection task, each with its own understanding and definition of what a"community"is.
background_label: Dozens of review works attempt to order such a diverse landscape -- classifying community discovery algorithms by the process they employ to detect communities, by their explicitly stated definition of community, or by their performance on a standardized task.
method_label: In this paper, we classify community discovery algorithms according to a fourth criterion: the similarity of their results.
method_label: We create an Algorithm Similarity Network (ASN), whose nodes are the community detection approaches, connected if they return similar groupings.
method_label: We then perform community detection on this network, grouping algorithms that consistently return the same partitions or overlapping coverage over a span of more than one thousand synthetic and real world networks.
objective_label: This paper is an attempt to create a similarity-based classification of community detection algorithms based on empirical data.
result_label: It improves over the state of the art by comparing more than seventy approaches, discovering that the ASN contains well-separated groups, making it a sensible tool for practitioners, aiding their choice of algorithms fitting their analytic needs.

TITLE: Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles: a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance.
background_label: This striking level of coordination is thought to have arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status.
background_label: But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to become a reflex?
method_label: We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imagined characters do).
result_label: Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus.
result_label: We also report suggestive preliminary findings on the effects of gender and other features; e.g., surprisingly, for articles, on average, characters adapt more to females than to males.

TITLE: Community Specific Temporal Topic Discovery from Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Studying temporal dynamics of topics in social media is very useful to understand online user behaviors.
background_label: Most of the existing work on this subject usually monitors the global trends, ignoring variation among communities.
background_label: Since users from different communities tend to have varying tastes and interests, capturing community-level temporal change can improve the understanding and management of social content.
background_label: Additionally, it can further facilitate the applications such as community discovery, temporal prediction and online marketing.
background_label: However, this kind of extraction becomes challenging due to the intricate interactions between community and topic, and intractable computational complexity.
background_label: In this paper, we take a unified solution towards the community-level topic dynamic extraction.
objective_label: A probabilistic model, CosTot (Community Specific Topics-over-Time) is proposed to uncover the hidden topics and communities, as well as capture community-specific temporal dynamics.
method_label: Specifically, CosTot considers text, time, and network information simultaneously, and well discovers the interactions between community and topic over time.
method_label: We then discuss the approximate inference implementation to enable scalable computation of model parameters, especially for large social data.
method_label: Based on this, the application layer support for multi-scale temporal analysis and community exploration is also investigated.
result_label: We conduct extensive experimental studies on a large real microblog dataset, and demonstrate the superiority of proposed model on tasks of time stamp prediction, link prediction and topic perplexity.

TITLE: Pathways to informal leadership: The moderating role of gender on the relationship of individual differences and team member network centrality to informal leadership emergence
ABSTRACT: background_label: Despite extensive research on leadership, very little is known about the emergence of informal leaders in teams that have worked together over an extended period of time within “real” organizational contexts.
background_label: These teams are increasingly composed of both men and women, making gender a potentially critical variable in the dynamics of informal leadership emergence.
objective_label: This study examines how gender moderates the relationship between individual characteristics and informal leadership emergence in the context of intact manufacturing teams.
result_label: Whereas a high level of conscientiousness, emotional stability, and team member network centrality predicted informal leadership more for men than for women, a high level of general mental ability predicted informal leadership more for women than for men.
result_label: The implications for gender and informal leadership in intact teams are discussed.

TITLE: On the relation of speech to language.
ABSTRACT: background_label: There are two widely divergent theories about the relation of speech to language.
background_label: The more conventional view holds that the elements of speech are sounds that rely for their production and perception on two wholly separate processes, neither of which is distinctly linguistic.
background_label: Accordingly, the primary motor and perceptual representations are inappropriate for linguistic purposes until a cognitive process of some sort has connected them to language and to each other.
background_label: The less conventional theory takes the speech elements to be articulatory gestures that are the primary objects of both production and perception.
background_label: Those gestures form a natural class that serves a linguistic function and no other.
background_label: Therefore, their representations are immediately linguistic, requiring no cognitive intervention to make them appropriate for use by the other components of the language system.
method_label: The unconventional view provides the more plausible answers to three important questions: (1) How was the necessary parity between speaker and listener established in evolution, and how maintained?
method_label: (2) How does speech meet the special requirements that underlie its ability, unique among natural communication systems, to encode an indefinitely large number of meanings?
other_label: (3) What biological properties of speech make it easier than the reading and writing of its alphabetic transcription?

TITLE: Topic words analysis based on LDA model
ABSTRACT: background_label: Social network analysis (SNA), which is a research field describing and modeling the social connection of a certain group of people, is popular among network services.
method_label: Our topic words analysis project is a SNA method to visualize the topic words among emails from Obama.com to accounts registered in Columbus, Ohio.
method_label: Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a popular topic model of SNA, our project characterizes the preference of senders for target group of receptors.
method_label: Gibbs sampling is used to estimate topic and word distribution.
method_label: Our training and testing data are emails from the carbon-free server Datagreening.com.
method_label: We use parallel computing tool BashReduce for word processing and generate related words under each latent topic to discovers typical information of political news sending specially to local Columbus receptors.
method_label: Running on two instances using paralleling tool BashReduce, our project contributes almost 30% speedup processing the raw contents, comparing with processing contents on one instance locally.
result_label: Also, the experimental result shows that the LDA model applied in our project provides precision rate 53.96% higher than TF-IDF model finding target words, on the condition that appropriate size of topic words list is selected.

TITLE: A method for assessing the success and failure of community-level interventions in the presence of network diffusion, social reinforcement, and related social effects
ABSTRACT: background_label: Prevention and intervention work done within community settings often face unique analytic challenges for rigorous evaluations.
background_label: Since community prevention work (often geographically isolated) cannot be controlled in the same way other prevention programs and these communities have an increased level of interpersonal interactions, rigorous evaluations are needed.
background_label: Even when the `gold standard' randomized control trials are implemented within community intervention work, the threats to internal validity can be called into question given informal social spread of information in closed network settings.
method_label: A new prevention evaluation method is presented here to disentangle the social influences assumed to influence prevention effects within communities.
method_label: We formally introduce the method and it's utility for a suicide prevention program implemented in several Alaska Native villages.
result_label: The results show promise to explore eight sociological measures of intervention effects in the face of social diffusion, social reinforcement, and direct treatment.
result_label: Policy and research implication are discussed.

TITLE: SocialLens: Searching and Browsing Communities by Content and Interaction
ABSTRACT: background_label: Community analysis is an important task in graph mining.
background_label: Most of the existing community studies are community detection, which aim to find the community membership for each user based on the user friendship links.
background_label: However, membership alone, without a complete profile of what a community is and how it interacts with other communities, has limited applications.
objective_label: This motivates us to consider systematically profiling the communities and thereby developing useful community-level applications.
method_label: In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of community profiling, upon which we build a SocialLens system1 to enable searching and browsing communities by content and interaction.
method_label: We deploy SocialLens on two social graphs: Twitter and DBLP.
result_label: We demonstrate two useful applications of SocialLens, including interactive community visualization and profile-aware community ranking.

TITLE: Classification schema for online communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: A synthesis of the literature suggests that the key characteristics for classifying online communities are: (i) their attributes, (ii) supporting software, (iii) their relationship to physical communities, and (iv) the sociological concept of boundedness.
background_label: A classification schema based on these four characteristics is presented in this paper.
background_label: Examples of each type of community are discussed.
background_label: These classification schema have important implications for the design and management of online communities.
background_label: Computer networks, such as the Internet, have begun to connect people around the world.
background_label: In the past, access to computermediated communication was mostly limited to employees in the government, military, or university research communities (King, Grinter, and Pickering, 1997), and to work-related tasks (Greif, 1988).
result_label: As more diverse groups of people gain access to computer networks, a new type of communication group, known as an online community, has begun to emerge.
other_label: What is an online community (also called a virtual community or an electronic community)?
result_label: Although there is an increasing amount of research being done on online communities, there is no standard definition, and there are several different classification schema.
background_label: These classifications partially represent the different academic perspectives, of the technologist, sociologist, psychologist, etc.
objective_label: The purpose of this paper is to examine the different classification schema that have been presented for classifying online communities.
background_label: Although these classification schema are by no means exclusive or exhaustive, they can assist in identifying online communities that are similar.
objective_label: Discovering these similarities may help to improve the development of different kinds of communities.
background_label: For example, similar communities may benefit from similar technical design and structure.
background_label: These communities may have similar needs, such as moderation.
method_label: Within similarly structured online communities, there may be certain research methodologies that are more appropriate than others.
method_label: In the literature, four different schema for classifying online communities have been presented.
result_label: These four schema classify communities by: (i) attributes, (ii) supporting software, (iii) relationship to physical communities, and (iv) boundedness.

TITLE: Computational Decomposition of Style for Controllable and Enhanced Style Transfer
ABSTRACT: background_label: Neural style transfer has been demonstrated to be powerful in creating artistic image with help of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
background_label: However, there is still lack of computational analysis of perceptual components of the artistic style.
objective_label: Different from some early attempts which studied the style by some pre-processing or post-processing techniques, we investigate the characteristics of the style systematically based on feature map produced by CNN.
method_label: First, we computationally decompose the style into basic elements using not only spectrum based methods including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) but also latent variable models such Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
method_label: Then, the decomposition of style induces various ways of controlling the style elements which could be embedded as modules in state-of-the-art style transfer algorithms.
method_label: Such decomposition of style brings several advantages.
method_label: It enables the computational coding of different artistic styles by our style basis with similar styles clustering together, and thus it facilitates the mixing or intervention of styles based on the style basis from more than one styles so that compound style or new style could be generated to produce styled images.
result_label: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on not only painting style transfer but also sketch style transfer which indicates possible applications on picture-to-sketch problems.

TITLE: Overcoming Language Variation in Sentiment Analysis with Social Attention
ABSTRACT: background_label: Variation in language is ubiquitous, particularly in newer forms of writing such as social media.
background_label: Fortunately, variation is not random, it is often linked to social properties of the author.
objective_label: In this paper, we show how to exploit social networks to make sentiment analysis more robust to social language variation.
objective_label: The key idea is linguistic homophily: the tendency of socially linked individuals to use language in similar ways.
method_label: We formalize this idea in a novel attention-based neural network architecture, in which attention is divided among several basis models, depending on the author's position in the social network.
method_label: This has the effect of smoothing the classification function across the social network, and makes it possible to induce personalized classifiers even for authors for whom there is no labeled data or demographic metadata.
result_label: This model significantly improves the accuracies of sentiment analysis on Twitter and on review data.

TITLE: Computational Measures For Language Similarity Across Time In Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper examines language similarity in messages over time in an online community of adolescents from around the world using three computational measures: Spearman's Correlation Coefficient, Zipping and Latent Semantic Analysis.
background_label: Results suggest that the participants' language diverges over a six-week period, and that divergence is not mediated by demographic variables such as leadership status or gender.
result_label: This divergence may represent the introduction of more unique words over time, and is influenced by a continual change in subtopics over time, as well as community-wide historical events that introduce new vocabulary at later time periods.
result_label: Our results highlight both the possibilities and shortcomings of using document similarity measures to assess convergence in language use.

method_label: We propose a new probabilistic graphical model called MCTA which can cope with the language gap and capture the common semantics in different languages.
method_label: We also develop a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler which effectively incorporates the term translation relationship into the detection of cultural-common topics for model parameter learning.
result_label: Experimental results show improvements over the state-of-the-art model.

TITLE: The prefrontal cortex and its relation to behavior.
ABSTRACT: background_label: The prefrontal cortex is critical for temporal organization of behavior.
background_label: It mediates cross-temporal sensory-motor contingencies, integrating motor action (including speech) with recent sensory information.
method_label: It performs this role through cooperation of two cognitive functions represented in its dorsolateral areas: short-term memory (STM) and preparatory set.
method_label: Supporting data have been obtained from monkeys performing delay tasks, which epitomize the principle of cross-temporal contingency.
method_label: In a given trial, the animal performs an act contingent on a sensory cue given a few seconds or minutes earlier.
result_label: During the delay between cue and response, cells in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show sustained activation.
background_label: Two cell categories can be identified in tasks in which cue and response are spatially separate.
background_label: Cells of the first participate in STM: Their activation tends to diminish as the delay progresses; in some, the activation level depends on the particular cue received.
background_label: Similar cells are found elsewhere in cortex.
background_label: Cells of the second category seem to take part in preparation of motor response: Their activation tends to increase in anticipation of it and may be attuned to the particular movement the cue calls for.
background_label: This cell type is rare outside of frontal cortex.
result_label: The temporally integrative function of the prefrontal cortex is probably based on local interactions between "memory" and "motor-set" cells, as well as on neural associations between prefrontal cortex and posterior cortical areas.

TITLE: The Aftermath of Disbanding an Online Hateful Community
ABSTRACT: background_label: Harassing and hateful speech in online spaces has become a common problem for platform maintainers and their users.
background_label: The toxicity created by such content can discourage user participation and engagement.
background_label: Therefore, it is crucial for and a common goal of platform managers to diminish hateful and harmful content.
objective_label: Over the last year, Reddit, a major online platform, enacted a policy of banning sub-communities (subreddits) that they deem harassing, with the goal of diminishing such activities.
method_label: We studied the effects of banning the largest hateful subreddit (r/fatpeoplehate or FPH) on the users and other subreddits that were associated with it.
method_label: We found that, while a number of outcomes were possible --- in this case the subreddit ban led to a sustained reduced interaction of its members (FPH users) with the Reddit platform.
result_label: We also found that the many counter-actions taken by FPH users were short-lived and promptly neutralized by both Reddit administrators and the admins of individual subreddits.
result_label: Our findings show that forum-banning can be an effective means by which to diminish objectionable content.
result_label: Moreover, our detailed analysis of the post-banning behavior of FPH users highlights a number of the behavioral patterns that banning can create.

TITLE: R U : -) or : -( ? Character- vs. Word-Gram Feature Selection for Sentiment Classification of OSN Corpora
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract Binary sentiment classification, or sentiment analysis, is the task of computing the sentiment of a document, i.e.
background_label: whether it contains broadly positive or negative opinions.
background_label: The topic is well-studied, and the intuitive approach of using words as classification features is the basis of most techniques documented in the literature.
background_label: The alternative character n-gram language model has been applied successfully to a range of NLP tasks, but its effectiveness at sentiment classification seems to be under-investigated, and results are mixed.
method_label: We present an investigation of the application of the character n-gram model to text classification of corpora from online social networks, the first such documented study, where text is known to be rich in so-called unnatural language, also introducing a novel corpus of Facebook photo comments.
result_label: Despite hoping that the flexibility of the character n-gram approach would be well-suited to unnatural language phenomenon, we find little improvement over the baseline algorithms employing the word n-gram language model.

TITLE: Disputes, Democracies, and Dependencies: A Reexamination of the Kantian Peace
ABSTRACT: background_label: Militarized interstate disputes are widely thought to be less likely among democratic countries that have high levels of trade and extensive participation in international organizations.
background_label: We reexamine this broad finding of the Kantian peace literature in the context of a model that incorporates the high degree of dependency among countries.
background_label: Based on in-sample statistical tests, as well as out-of-sample, predictive cross-validation, we find that results frequently cited in the literature are plagued by overfitting and cannot be characterized as identifying the underlying structure through which international conflict is influenced by democracy, trade, and international governmental organizations.
method_label: We conclude that much of the statistical association typically reported in this literature apparently stems from three components: (1) geographical proximity, (2) dependence among militarized interstate disputes with the same initiator or target, and (3) the higher-order dependencies in these dyadic data.
method_label: Once these are incorporated, covariates associated with the Kantian peace tripod lose most of their statistical power.
result_label: We do find that higher levels of joint democracy are associated with lower probabilities of militarized interstate dispute involvement.
result_label: We find that despite high statistical significance and putative substantive importance, none of the variables representing the Kantian tripod is associated with any substantial degree of predictive power.

TITLE: The Relation of Language to Materials
ABSTRACT: background_label: It is not the purpose of this chapter to delve yet again into the meaning of the term ‘expression’ used with respect to music.
objective_label: We will be concerned with one aspect of music perception brought to the fore once more by the development of electroacoustic music on tape: namely the possible relation of the sounds to associated or evoked images in the mind of the listener.
background_label: The term ‘image’ may be interpreted as lying somewhere between true synaesthesia with visual image1 and a more ambiguous complex of auditory, visual and emotional stimuli.
result_label: We are concerned here not with how specific sources may evoke particular images but with how the imagery evoked interacts with more abstact aspects of musical composition.

TITLE: TextFlow: Towards Better Understanding of Evolving Topics in Text
ABSTRACT: background_label: Understanding how topics evolve in text data is an important and challenging task.
background_label: Although much work has been devoted to topic analysis, the study of topic evolution has largely been limited to individual topics.
objective_label: In this paper, we introduce TextFlow, a seamless integration of visualization and topic mining techniques, for analyzing various evolution patterns that emerge from multiple topics.
method_label: We first extend an existing analysis technique to extract three-level features: the topic evolution trend, the critical event, and the keyword correlation.
method_label: Then a coherent visualization that consists of three new visual components is designed to convey complex relationships between them.
method_label: Through interaction, the topic mining model and visualization can communicate with each other to help users refine the analysis result and gain insights into the data progressively.
result_label: Finally, two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of TextFlow in helping users understand the major topic evolution patterns in time-varying text data.

TITLE: Robust topic inference for latent semantic language model adaptation
ABSTRACT: background_label: We perform topic-based, unsupervised language model adaptation under an N-best rescoring framework by using previous-pass system hypotheses to infer a topic mixture which is used to select topic-dependent LMs for interpolation with a topic-independent LM.
objective_label: Our primary focus is on techniques for improving the robustness of topic inference for a given utterance with respect to recognition errors, including the use of ASR confidence and contextual information from surrounding utterances.
result_label: We describe a novel application of metadata-based pseudo-story segmentation to language model adaptation, and present good improvements to character error rate on multi-genre GALE Project data in Mandarin Chinese.

TITLE: Online extremism and the communities that sustain it: Detecting the ISIS supporting community on Twitter
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) continues to use social media as an essential element of its campaign to motivate support.
background_label: On Twitter, ISIS' unique ability to leverage unaffiliated sympathizers that simply retweet propaganda has been identified as a primary mechanism in their success in motivating both recruitment and "lone wolf" attacks.
objective_label: The present work explores a large community of Twitter users whose activity supports ISIS propaganda diffusion in varying degrees.
method_label: Within this ISIS supporting community, we observe a diverse range of actor types, including fighters, propagandists, recruiters, religious scholars, and unaffiliated sympathizers.
method_label: The interaction between these users offers unique insight into the people and narratives critical to ISIS' sustainment.
method_label: In their entirety, we refer to this diverse set of users as an online extremist community or OEC.
result_label: We present Iterative Vertex Clustering and Classification (IVCC), a scalable analytic approach for OEC detection in annotated heterogeneous networks, and provide an illustrative case study of an online community of over 22,000 Twitter users whose online behavior directly advocates support for ISIS or contibutes to the group's propaganda dissemination through retweets.

TITLE: Discriminating between similar languages in Twitter using label propagation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Identifying the language of social media messages is an important first step in linguistic processing.
background_label: Existing models for Twitter focus on content analysis, which is successful for dissimilar language pairs.
method_label: We propose a label propagation approach that takes the social graph of tweet authors into account as well as content to better tease apart similar languages.
result_label: This results in state-of-the-art shared task performance of $76.63\%$, $1.4\%$ higher than the top system.

TITLE: Probabilistic Topic Models for Learning Terminological Ontologies
ABSTRACT: background_label: Probabilistic topic models were originally developed and utilized for document modeling and topic extraction in Information Retrieval.
objective_label: In this paper, we describe a new approach for automatic learning of terminological ontologies from text corpus based on such models.
method_label: In our approach, topic models are used as efficient dimension reduction techniques, which are able to capture semantic relationships between word-topic and topic-document interpreted in terms of probability distributions.
method_label: We propose two algorithms for learning terminological ontologies using the principle of topic relationship and exploiting information theory with the probabilistic topic models learned.
method_label: Experiments with different model parameters were conducted and learned ontology statements were evaluated by the domain experts.
result_label: We have also compared the results of our method with two existing concept hierarchy learning methods on the same data set.
result_label: The study shows that our method outperforms other methods in terms of recall and precision measures.
result_label: The precision level of the learned ontology is sufficient for it to be deployed for the purpose of browsing, navigation, and information search and retrieval in digital libraries.

TITLE: Mining topic-specific concepts and definitions on the web
ABSTRACT: background_label: Traditionally, when one wants to learn about a particular topic, one reads a book or a survey paper.
background_label: With the rapid expansion of the Web, learning in-depth knowledge about a topic from the Web is becoming increasingly important and popular.
background_label: This is also due to the Web's convenience and its richness of information.
background_label: In many cases, learning from the Web may even be essential because in our fast changing world, emerging topics appear constantly and rapidly.
background_label: There is often not enough time for someone to write a book on such topics.
background_label: To learn such emerging topics, one can resort to research papers.
background_label: However, research papers are often hard to understand by non-researchers, and few research papers cover every aspect of the topic.
result_label: In contrast, many Web pages often contain intuitive descriptions of the topic.
background_label: To find such Web pages, one typically uses a search engine.
background_label: However, current search techniques are not designed for in-depth learning.
background_label: Top ranking pages from a search engine may not contain any description of the topic.
background_label: Even if they do, the description is usually incomplete since it is unlikely that the owner of the page has good knowledge of every aspect of the topic.
objective_label: In this paper, we attempt a novel and challenging task, mining topic-specific knowledge on the Web.
objective_label: Our goal is to help people learn in-depth knowledge of a topic systematically on the Web.
method_label: The proposed techniques first identify those sub-topics or salient concepts of the topic, and then find and organize those informative pages, containing definitions and descriptions of the topic and sub-topics, just like those in a book.
result_label: Experimental results using 28 topics show that the proposed techniques are highly effective.

TITLE: Topic Grouper: An Agglomerative Clustering Approach to Topic Modeling
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce Topic Grouper as a complementary approach in the field of probabilistic topic modeling.
background_label: Topic Grouper creates a disjunctive partitioning of the training vocabulary in a stepwise manner such that resulting partitions represent topics.
method_label: It is governed by a simple generative model, where the likelihood to generate the training documents via topics is optimized.
method_label: The algorithm starts with one-word topics and joins two topics at every step.
method_label: It therefore generates a solution for every desired number of topics ranging between the size of the training vocabulary and one.
method_label: The process represents an agglomerative clustering that corresponds to a binary tree of topics.
background_label: A resulting tree may act as a containment hierarchy, typically with more general topics towards the root of tree and more specific topics towards the leaves.
background_label: Topic Grouper is not governed by a background distribution such as the Dirichlet and avoids hyper parameter optimizations.
background_label: We show that Topic Grouper has reasonable predictive power and also a reasonable theoretical and practical complexity.
method_label: Topic Grouper can deal well with stop words and function words and tends to push them into their own topics.
method_label: Also, it can handle topic distributions, where some topics are more frequent than others.
method_label: We present typical examples of computed topics from evaluation datasets, where topics appear conclusive and coherent.
result_label: In this context, the fact that each word belongs to exactly one topic is not a major limitation; in some scenarios this can even be a genuine advantage, e.g.~a related shopping basket analysis may aid in optimizing groupings of articles in sales catalogs.

ABSTRACT: background_label: This is the first work investigating community structure and interaction dynamics through the lens of quotes in online discussion forums.
background_label: We examine four forums of different size, language, and topic.
result_label: Quote usage, which is surprisingly consistent over time and users, appears to have an important role in aiding intra-thread navigation, and uncovers a hidden"social"structure in communities otherwise lacking all trappings (from friends and followers to reputations) of today's social networks.

TITLE: The power of gifts: organizing social relationships in open source communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract.
background_label: In writings on the open source software development model, it is often argued that it is successful as a result of the gift economy that embraces activities in online communities
background_label: I N T RO D U C T I O NIn writings on open source software, it is often argued that software development is founded on gift relationships, in which pieces of code are shared in the form of gifts to the community of open source developers.
background_label: Raymond (1999a), for instance, examines the open source hacker milieu as a difference between exchange cultures and gift cultures.
background_label: Gift cultures differ from exchange cultures in that the latter are characterized by scarcity and the former by abundance.
background_label: In gift cultures, Raymond argues, social status is determined 'not by what you control but by what you give away' (Raymond, 1999a: 99).Vaguely referring to the classic work by Mauss (1950 Mauss ( /1999, Raymond catches some fundamental and important aspects of the cultural logic of gift-giving and sharing practices that are vital for the success of open source software development.
result_label: However, he does not really dig into the theoretical foundations that lead to these conclusions.
other_label: In this paper, we seek to develop Raymond's arguments by relating them to the work of Mauss and his followers.Info Systems J (2001) 11, 305-320 305

TITLE: A Unified Graph Model for Sentence-Based Opinion Retrieval
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThere is a growing research interest in opinion retrieval as on-line users' opinions are becoming more and more popular in business, social networks, etc.
objective_label: Practically speaking, the goal of opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, which entail opinions or comments, relevant to a target subject specified by the user's query.
objective_label: A fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is information representation.
method_label: Existing research focuses on document-based approaches and documents are represented by bag-of-word.
result_label: However, due to loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target.
background_label: It cannot distinguish different degrees of a sentiment word when associated with different targets.
background_label: This in turn seriously affects opinion retrieval performance.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach based on a new information representation, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to capture intra-sentence contextual information between an opinion and its target.
method_label: Additionally, we consider inter-sentence information to capture the relationships among the opinions on the same topic.
method_label: Finally, the two types of information are combined in a unified graph-based model, which can effectively rank the documents.
result_label: Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on the COAE08 dataset showed that our graph-based model achieved significant improvement.

TITLE: Topic model allocation of conversational dialogue records by Latent Dirichlet Allocation
ABSTRACT: background_label: The topic information of conversational content is important for continuation with communication, so topic detection and tracking is one of important research.
background_label: Due to there are many topic transform occurring frequently in long time communication, and the conversation maybe have many topics, so it's important to detect different topics in conversational content.
method_label: This paper detects topic information by using agglomerative clustering of utterances and Dynamic Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, uses proportion of verb and noun to analyze similarity between utterances and cluster all utterances in conversational content by agglomerative clustering algorithm.
method_label: The topic structure of conversational content is friability, so we use speech act information and gets the hypernym information by E-HowNet that obtains robustness of word categories.
method_label: Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is used to detect topic in file units, it just can detect only one topic if uses it in conversational content, because of there are many topics in conversational content frequently, and also uses speech act information and hypernym information to train the latent Dirichlet allocation models, then uses trained models to detect different topic information in conversational content.
result_label: For evaluating the proposed method, support vector machine is developed for comparison.
result_label: According to the experimental results, we can find the proposed method outperforms the approach based on support vector machine in topic detection and tracking in spoken dialogue.

TITLE: Mining slang and urban opinion words and phrases from cQA services: an optimization approach
ABSTRACT: background_label: Current opinion lexicons contain most of the common opinion words, but they miss slang and so-called urban opinion words and phrases (e.g.
background_label: delish, cozy, yummy, nerdy, and yuck).
background_label: These subjectivity clues are frequently used in community questions and are useful for opinion question analysis.
objective_label: This paper introduces a principled approach to constructing an opinion lexicon for community-based question answering (cQA) services.
method_label: We formulate the opinion lexicon induction as a semi-supervised learning task in the graph context.
method_label: Our method makes use of existing opinion words to extract new opinion entities (slang and urban words/phrases) from community questions.
method_label: It then models the opinion entities in a graph context to learn the polarity of the new opinion entities based on the graph connectivity information.
method_label: In contrast to previous approaches, our method not only learns such polarities from the labeled data but also from the unlabeled data and is more feasible in the web context where the dictionary-based relations (such as synonym, antonym, or hyponym) between most words are not available for constructing a high quality graph.
result_label: The experiments show that our approach is effective both in terms of the quality of the discovered new opinion entities as well as its ability in inferring their polarity.
result_label: Furthermore, since the value of opinion lexicons lies in their usefulness in applications, we show the utility of the constructed lexicon in the sentiment classification task.

TITLE: Dynamic Social Community Detection and Its Applications
ABSTRACT: background_label: Community structure is one of the most commonly observed features of Online Social Networks (OSNs) in reality.
background_label: The knowledge of this feature is of great advantage: it not only provides helpful insights into developing more efficient social-aware solutions but also promises a wide range of applications enabled by social and mobile networking, such as routing strategies in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and worm containment in OSNs.
background_label: Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social interactions are evolving rapidly.
objective_label: Our work focuses on the following questions: How can we efficiently identify communities in dynamic social networks?
result_label: How can we adaptively update the network community structure based on its history instead of recomputing from scratch?
background_label: To this end, we present Quick Community Adaptation (QCA), an adaptive modularity-based framework for not only discovering but also tracing the evolution of network communities in dynamic OSNs.
background_label: QCA is very fast and efficient in the sense that it adaptively updates and discovers the new community structure based on its history together with the network changes only.
method_label: This flexible approach makes QCA an ideal framework applicable for analyzing large-scale dynamic social networks due to its lightweight computing-resource requirement.
method_label: To illustrate the effectiveness of our framework, we extensively test QCA on both synthesized and real-world social networks including Enron, arXiv e-print citation, and Facebook networks.
method_label: Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of QCA in real applications: (1) A social-aware message forwarding strategy in MANETs, and (2) worm propagation containment in OSNs.
result_label: Competitive results in comparison with other methods reveal that social-based techniques employing QCA as a community detection core outperform current available methods.

TITLE: Gaia, God, and the Internet: The History of Evolution and the Utopia of Community in Media Society
ABSTRACT: background_label: The question of religious content in the media has occupied many scholars studying the relationship between media and religion.
background_label: However, the study of recent religious thought offers a promising perspective for the analysis of the cultural perceptions of various media technologies.
background_label: After the Internet first appeared in American households in the middle of the 1990s, a variety of religious or spiritual interpretations of the new medium emerged.
background_label: The far-reaching ideas see the Internet as the first step of the realisation of a divine entity consisting of the collective human mind.
method_label: In this vision, the emergence of the Internet is considered to be part of a teleological evolutionary model.
method_label: Essential for the religious and evolutionary construction of the Internet is an incorporation of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's model of evolution — especially the idea of the noosphere, and its adoption in media theory by Marshall McLuhan.
result_label: The connections of these ideas to James Lovelock's Gaia theory illustrate the notion of the Internet as an organic entity.
result_label: The article outlines the processes of the reception of religious and evolutionary ideas which led to the recent interpretations of the Internet as a divine sphere.

TITLE: Who Wrote This? Textual Modeling with Authorship Attribution in Big Data
ABSTRACT: background_label: By representing large corpora with concise and meaningful elements, topic-based generative models aim to reduce the dimension and understand the content of documents.
background_label: Those techniques originally analyze on words in the documents, but their extensions currently accommodate meta-data such as authorship information, which has been proved useful for textual modeling.
objective_label: The importance of learning authorship is to extract author interests and assign authors to anonymous texts.
method_label: Author-Topic (AT) model, an unsupervised learning technique, successfully exploits authorship information to model both documents and author interests using topic representations.
method_label: However, the AT model simplifies that each author has equal contribution on multiple-author documents.
background_label: To overcome this limitation, we assumes that authors give different degrees of contributions on a document by using a Dirichlet distribution.
background_label: This automatically transforms the unsupervised AT model to Supervised Author-Topic (SAT) model, which brings a novelty of authorship prediction on anonymous texts.
method_label: The SAT model outperforms the AT model for identifying authors of documents written by either single authors or multiple authors with a better Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and a significantly higher Area Under Curve (AUC).
method_label: The SAT model not only achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art techniques e.g.
method_label: Random forests but also maintains the characteristics of the unsupervised models for information discovery i.e.
result_label: Word distributions of topics, author interests, and author contributions.

TITLE: Are social bots a real threat? An agent-based model of the spiral of silence to analyse the impact of manipulative actors in social networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: ABSTRACTInformation systems such as social media strongly influence public opinion formation.
background_label: Additionally, communication on the internet is shaped by individuals and organisations with various aims.
background_label: This environment has given rise to phenomena such as manipulated content, fake news, and social bots.
objective_label: To examine the influence of manipulated opinions, we draw on the spiral of silence theory and complex adaptive systems.
method_label: We translate empirical evidence of individual behaviour into an agent-based model and show that the model results in the emergence of a consensus on the collective level.
method_label: In contrast to most previous approaches, this model explicitly represents interactions as a network.
method_label: The most central actor in the network determines the final consensus 60–70% of the time.
method_label: We then use the model to examine the influence of manipulative actors such as social bots on public opinion formation.
result_label: The results indicate that, in a highly polarised setting, depending on their network position and the overall network ...

TITLE: Characterizing Conversation Patterns in Reddit: From the Perspectives of Content Properties and User Participation Behaviors
ABSTRACT: background_label: It becomes the norm for people to communicate with one another through various online social channels, where different conversation structures are formed depending on platforms.
background_label: One of the common online communication patterns is a threaded conversation where a user brings up a conversation topic, and then other people respond to the initiator or other participants by commenting, which can be modeled as a tree structure.
objective_label: This paper seeks to investigate (i) the characteristics of online threaded conversations in terms of volume, responsiveness, and virality and (ii) what and how content properties and user participation behaviors are associated with such characteristics.
method_label: To this end, we collect 700~K threaded conversations from 1.5~M users in Reddit, one of the most popular online communities allowing people to communicate with others in the form of threaded conversations.
method_label: Using the collected dataset, we find that `social' words, difficulties of texts, and document relevancy are associated with the volume, responsiveness, and virality of conversations.
result_label: We also discover that large, viral conversations are mostly formed by a small portion of users who are reciprocally communicate with others by analyzing user interactions.
result_label: Our analysis on discovering user roles in conversations reveal that users who are interested in multiple topics play important roles in large and viral conversations, whereas heavy posting users play important roles in responsive conversations.
result_label: We expand our analysis to topical communities (i.e., subreddits) and find that news-related, image-based, and discussion-related communities are more likely to have large, responsive, and viral conversations, respectively.

TITLE: Structured Topic Models for Language
ABSTRACT: background_label: This thesis introduces new methods for statistically modelling text using topic models.
background_label: Topic models have seen many successes in recent years, and are used in a variety of applications, including analysis of news articles, topic-based search interfaces and navigation tools for digital libraries.
background_label: Despite these recent successes, the field of topic modelling is still relatively new and there remains much to be explored.
background_label: One noticeable absence from most of the previous work on topic modelling is consideration of language and document structure—from low-level structures, including word order and syntax, to higher-level structures, such as relationships between documents.
objective_label: The focus of this thesis is therefore structured topic models—models that combine latent topics with information about document structure, ranging from local sentence structure to inter-document relationships.
method_label: These models draw on techniques from Bayesian statistics, including hierarchical Dirichlet distributions and processes, Pitman-Yor processes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
method_label: Several methods for estimating the parameters of Dirichlet-multinomial distributions are also compared.
method_label: The main contribution of this thesis is the introduction of three structured topic models.
result_label: The first is a topic-based language model.
background_label: This model captures both word order and latent topics by extending a Bayesian topic model to incorporate n-gram statistics.
background_label: A bigram version of the new model does better at predicting future words than either a topic model or a trigram language model.
background_label: It also provides interpretable topics.
background_label: The second model arises from a Bayesian reinterpretation of a classic generative dependency parsing model.
method_label: The new model demonstrates that parsing performance can be substantially improved by a careful choice of prior and by sampling hyperparameters.
method_label: Additionally, the generative nature of the model facilitates the inclusion of latent state variables, which act as specialised part-of-speech tags or “syntactic topics”.
method_label: The third is a model that captures high-level relationships between documents.
method_label: This model uses nonparametric Bayesian priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to infer topic-based document clusters.
method_label: The model assigns a higher probability to unseen test documents than either a clustering model without topics or a Bayesian topic model without document clusters.
result_label: The model can be extended to incorporate author information, resulting in finer-grained clusters and better predictive performance.

TITLE: Using Sentiment Induction to Understand Variation in Gendered Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: We analyze gendered communities defined in three different ways: text, users, and sentiment.
background_label: Differences across these representations reveal facets of communities' distinctive identities, such as social group, topic, and attitudes.
background_label: Two communities may have high text similarity but not user similarity or vice versa, and word usage also does not vary according to a clearcut, binary perspective of gender.
result_label: Community-specific sentiment lexicons demonstrate that sentiment can be a useful indicator of words' social meaning and community values, especially in the context of discussion content and user demographics.
result_label: Our results show that social platforms such as Reddit are active settings for different constructions of gender.

TITLE: A Motif-based Approach for Identifying Controversy
ABSTRACT: background_label: Among the topics discussed in Social Media, some lead to controversy.
background_label: A number of recent studies have focused on the problem of identifying controversy in social media mostly based on the analysis of textual content or rely on global network structure.
background_label: Such approaches have strong limitations due to the difficulty of understanding natural language, and of investigating the global network structure.
objective_label: In this work we show that it is possible to detect controversy in social media by exploiting network motifs, i.e., local patterns of user interaction.
method_label: The proposed approach allows for a language-independent and fine- grained and efficient-to-compute analysis of user discussions and their evolution over time.
result_label: The supervised model exploiting motif patterns can achieve 85% accuracy, with an improvement of 7% compared to baseline structural, propagation-based and temporal network features.

TITLE: Active Community Environments and Health: The Relationship of Walkable and Safe Communities to Individual Health
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract The literature suggests that individuals will be healthier if they live in Active Community Environments that promote exercise and activity.
background_label: Two key elements of such environments are walkability and safety.
result_label: Examining data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1988-1994 and using a multilevel analysis, we found that individuals who live in counties that are more walkable and have lower crime rates tended to walk more and to have lower body mass indices (BMIs) than people in less walk-able and more crime-prone areas, even after controlling for a variety of individual variables related to health.
result_label: Among lifelong residents of an area, lesser walk-ability and more crime were also associated with respondents reporting weight-related chronic illness and lower ratings of their own health.
result_label: The effect of high crime rates was substantially stronger for women than for men, and taking this interaction into account eliminated gender differences in walking, BMI, weight-related chronic co...

TITLE: Feature Based Adaptation for Speaking Style Synthesis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Speaking style plays an important role in the expressivity of speech for communication.
background_label: Hence speaking style is very important for synthetic speech as well.
background_label: Speaking style adaptation faces the difficulty that the data of specific styles may be limited and difficult to obtain in large amounts.
objective_label: A possible solution is to leverage data from speaking styles that are more available, to train the speech synthesizer and then adapt it to the target style for which the data is scarce.
method_label: Conventional DNN adaptation approaches directly update the top layers of a well-trained, style-dependent model towards the target style.
method_label: The detailed local context-level mismatch between the original and the target styles is not considered.
method_label: In order to address this issue, two frame-level input feature-based style adaptation techniques are investigated in this paper.
method_label: We will use style features extracted from (1) a target-style data trained bottleneck DNN, and (2) a novel cross-style residual feature regression DNN.
method_label: These features are used for top-layer adaptation of a well-trained style-dependent synthesis network.
result_label: Experimental results on adapting the declarative sty le to the interrogative sty le demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed style features in improving the expressiveness of synthesizing speech for the interrogative style, while maintaining speech quality.

TITLE: An entropy-based social network community detecting method and its application to scientometrics
ABSTRACT: background_label: Community structure is one of the important properties of social networks in general and in particular the citation networks in the field of scientometrics.
background_label: A majority of existing methods are not proper for detecting communities in a directed network, and thus hinders their applications in the citation networks.
method_label: In this paper, we provide a novel method which not only overcomes the above mentioned disability, but also has a relative low algorithm time complexity which facilitates the application in large scale networks.
method_label: We use the concept of Shannon entropy to measure a network’s information and then consider the process of detecting communities as a process of information loss.
method_label: Based on this idea, we develop an optimal model to depict the process of detecting communities and further introduce the principle of dynamic programming to solve the model.
method_label: A simulation test is also designed to examine the model’s accuracy in discovering the community structure and identifying the optimal community number.
result_label: Finally, we apply our method in a citation network from the journal Scientometrics and then provide several insights on promising research topics through the detected communities by our method.

TITLE: Local Community Detection Using Link Similarity
ABSTRACT: background_label: Exploring local community structure is an appealing problem that has drawn much recent attention in the area of social network analysis.
background_label: As the complete information of network is often difficult to obtain, such as networks of web pages, research papers and Facebook users, people can only detect community structure from a certain source vertex with limited knowledge of the entire graph.
background_label: The existing approaches do well in measuring the community quality, but they are largely dependent on source vertex and putting too strict policy in agglomerating new vertices.
background_label: Moreover, they have predefined parameters which are difficult to obtain.
method_label: This paper proposes a method to find local community structure by analyzing link similarity between the community and the vertex.
method_label: Inspired by the fact that elements in the same community are more likely to share common links, we explore community structure heuristically by giving priority to vertices which have a high link similarity with the community.
method_label: A three-phase process is also used for the sake of improving quality of community structure.
result_label: Experimental results prove that our method performs effectively not only in computer-generated graphs but also in real-world graphs.

ABSTRACT: background_label: In this monograph Professor B.K.Matilal studies what is today called "philosophy of language" on the basis of materials drawn exclusively from the works of classical Indian philosophers.
background_label: He provides not simply an exposition, but also an analysis of classical theories, allowing the texts to speak for themselves and avoiding any comparisons with modern theories.
result_label: The book is divided into two parts: one presents a survey of the general issues and problems; the other selects several special topics for study, such as sphota theory, the word as a unit of a sentence, the problem of translation, and an elaboration of Bhatrhari's view of cognition.

TITLE: Characterizing IoT Data and its Quality for Use
ABSTRACT: background_label: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a cyber physical social system that encompasses science, enterprise and societal domains.
background_label: Data is the most important commodity in IoT, enabling the"smarts"through analytics and decision making.
background_label: IoT environments can generate and consume vast amounts of data.
background_label: But managing this data effectively and gaining meaningful insights from it requires us to understand its characteristics.
background_label: Traditional scientific, enterprise and big data management approaches may not be adequate, and have to evolve.
background_label: Further, these characteristics and the physical deployment environments also impact the quality of the data for use.
method_label: In this paper, we offer a taxonomy of IoT data characteristics, along with data quality considerations, that are constructed from the ground-up based on the diverse IoT domains and applications we review.
method_label: We emphasize on the essential features, rather than a vast array of attributes.
method_label: We also indicate factors that influence the data quality.
result_label: Such a review is of value to IoT managers, data handlers and application composers in managing and making meaningful use of data, and for big data platform developers to offer meaningful solutions to address these considerations.

TITLE: Characterizing a national community web
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article presents a characterization of the community Web of the people of Portugal.
method_label: We defined criteria for delimiting this Web based on our past experience of crawling pages related to Portugal and collected over 3.2 million documents from 46,000 sites satisfying those criteria.
method_label: Our characterization was derived from this crawl.
method_label: We describe the rules that we established for defining the boundaries of this community Web and the methodology used to gather statistics.
method_label: Statistics cover the number and domain distribution of sites; the number, type and size distribution of text documents; and the linkage structure of this Web.
result_label: We also show how crawling constraints and abnormal situations on the Web can influence the statistics.

TITLE: Identifying Diachronic Topic-Based Research Communities by Clustering Shared Research Trajectories
ABSTRACT: background_label: Abstract.
background_label: Communities of academic authors are usually identified by means of standard community detection algorithms, which exploit 'static' relations, such as co-authorship or citation networks.
background_label: In contrast with these approaches, here we focus on diachronic topic-based communities -i.e., communities of people who appear to work on semantically related topics at the same time.
background_label: These communities are interesting because their analysis allows us to make sense of the dynamics of the research world -e.g., migration of researchers from one topic to another, new communities being spawn by older ones, communities splitting, merging, ceasing to exist, etc.
objective_label: To this purpose, we are interested in developing clustering methods that are able to handle correctly the dynamic aspects of topic-based community formation, prioritizing the relationship between researchers who appear to follow the same research trajectories.
method_label: We thus present a novel approach called Temporal Semantic Topic-Based Clustering (TST), which exploits a novel metric for clustering researchers according to their research trajectories, defined as distributions of semantic topics over time.
method_label: The approach has been evaluated through an empirical study involving 25 experts from the Semantic Web and Human-Computer Interaction areas.
result_label: The evaluation shows that TST exhibits a performance comparable to the one achieved by human experts.

ABSTRACT: background_label: A razor blade assembly which is flexible in at least one bending mode.
background_label: A seat member of substantially planar shape has an integrally formed guard located transversely along its forward margin.
background_label: The guard and seat members are formed of a flexible material.
method_label: A flexible blade having a sharpened edge along a transverse margin is disposed on a surface of the seat member having its edge parallel to and rearwardly located of the guard bar.
method_label: A cap member of flexible material has a planar surface in contact with the blade and a front margin located rearwardly of the cutting edge.
result_label: The seat, blade and cap are yieldingly bonded together and freely flexible about an axis parallel to the plane of the blade and perpendicular to the cutting edge.

TITLE: The network structure of mathematical knowledge according to the Wikipedia, MathWorld, and DLMF online libraries
ABSTRACT: background_label: We study the network structure of Wikipedia (restricted to its mathematical portion), MathWorld, and DLMF.
method_label: We approach these three online mathematical libraries from the perspective of several global and local network-theoretic features, providing for each one the appropriate value or distribution, along with comparisons that, if possible, also include the whole of the Wikipedia or the Web.
method_label: We identify some distinguishing characteristics of all three libraries, most of them supposedly traceable to the libraries' shared nature of relating to a very specialized domain.
result_label: Among these characteristics are the presence of a very large strongly connected component in each of the corresponding directed graphs, the complete absence of any clear power laws describing the distribution of local features, and the rise to prominence of some local features (e.g., stress centrality) that can be used to effectively search for keywords in the libraries.

TITLE: Augmenting Text Mining Approaches with Social Network Analysis to Understand the Complex Relationships among Users' Requests: A Case Study of the Android Operating System
ABSTRACT: background_label: Text mining approaches are being used increasingly for business analytics.
background_label: In particular, such approaches are now central to understanding users' feedback regarding systems delivered via online application distribution platforms such as Google Play.
background_label: In such settings, large volumes of reviews of potentially numerous apps and systems means that it is infeasible to use manual mechanisms to extract insights and knowledge that could inform product improvement.
method_label: In this context of identifying software system improvement options, text mining techniques are used to reveal the features that are mentioned most often as being in need of correction (e.g., GPS), and topics that are associated with features perceived as being defective (e.g., inaccuracy of GPS).
method_label: Other approaches may supplement such techniques to provide further insights for online communities and solution providers.
method_label: In this work we augment text mining approaches with social network analysis to demonstrate the utility of using multiple techniques.
result_label: Our outcomes suggest that text mining approaches may indeed be supplemented with other methods to deliver a broader range of insights.

TITLE: Leveraging Social Context for Modeling Topic Evolution
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic discovery and evolution (TDE) has been a problem which has gained long standing interest in the research community.
objective_label: The goal in topic discovery is to identify groups of keywords from large corpora so that the information in those corpora are summarized succinctly.
objective_label: The nature of text corpora has changed dramatically in the past few years with the advent of social media.
method_label: Social media services allow users to constantly share, follow and comment on posts from other users.
method_label: Hence, such services have given a new dimension to the traditional text corpus.
result_label: The new dimension being that today's corpora have a social context embedded in them in terms of the community of users interested in a particular post, their profiles etc.
objective_label: We wish to harness this social context that comes along with the textual content for TDE.
objective_label: In particular, our goal is to both qualitatively and quantitatively analyze when social context actually helps with TDE.
objective_label: Methodologically, we approach the problem of TDE by a proposing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based model that incorporates both the textual information and social context information.
method_label: We perform experiments on large scale real world dataset of news articles, and use Twitter as the platform providing information about the social context of these news articles.
result_label: We compare with and outperform several state-of-the-art baselines.
result_label: Our conclusion is that using the social context information is most useful when faced with topics that are particularly difficult to detect.

TITLE: How Sequence-to-Sequence Models Perceive Language Styles?
ABSTRACT: background_label: Style is ubiquitous in our daily language uses, while what is language style to learning machines?
background_label: In this paper, by exploiting the second-order statistics of semantic vectors of different corpora, we present a novel perspective on this question via style matrix, i.e.
objective_label: the covariance matrix of semantic vectors, and explain for the first time how Sequence-to-Sequence models encode style information innately in its semantic vectors.
method_label: As an application, we devise a learning-free text style transfer algorithm, which explicitly constructs a pair of transfer operators from the style matrices for style transfer.
method_label: Moreover, our algorithm is also observed to be flexible enough to transfer out-of-domain sentences.
result_label: Extensive experimental evidence justifies the informativeness of style matrix and the competitive performance of our proposed style transfer algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods.

TITLE: Unbiased Image Style Transfer
ABSTRACT: background_label: Recent fast image style transferring methods use feed-forward neural networks to generate an output image of desired style strength from the input pair of a content and a target style image.
background_label: In the existing methods, the image of intermediate style between the content and the target style is obtained by decoding a linearly interpolated feature in encoded feature space.
background_label: However, there has been no work on analyzing the effectiveness of this kind of style strength interpolation so far.
objective_label: In this paper, we tackle the missing work on the in-depth analysis of style interpolation and propose a method that is more effective in controlling style strength.
method_label: We interpret the training task of a style transfer network as a regression learning between the control parameter and output style strength.
method_label: In this understanding, the existing methods are biased due to the fact that training is performed with one-sided data of full style strength (alpha = 1.0).
method_label: Thus, this biased learning does not guarantee the generation of a desired intermediate style corresponding to the style control parameter between 0.0 and 1.0.
method_label: To solve this problem of the biased network, we propose an unbiased learning technique which uses unbiased training data and corresponding unbiased loss for alpha = 0.0 to make the feed-forward networks to generate a zero-style image, i.e., content image when alpha = 0.0.
result_label: Our experimental results verified that our unbiased learning method achieved the reconstruction of a content image with zero style strength, better regression specification between style control parameter and output style, and more stable style transfer that is insensitive to the weight of style loss without additive complexity in image generating process.

TITLE: Full-Text or Abstract? Examining Topic Coherence Scores Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
ABSTRACT: background_label: This paper assesses topic coherence and human topic ranking of uncovered latent topics from scientific publications when utilizing the topic model latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on abstract and full-text data.
background_label: The coherence of a topic, used as a proxy for topic quality, is based on the distributional hypothesis that states that words with similar meaning tend to co-occur within a similar context.
background_label: Although LDA has gained much attention from machine-learning researchers, most notably with its adaptations and extensions, little is known about the effects of different types of textual data on generated topics.
method_label: Our research is the first to explore these practical effects and shows that document frequency, document word length, and vocabulary size have mixed practical effects on topic coherence and human topic ranking of LDA topics.
result_label: We furthermore show that large document collections are less affected by incorrect or noise terms being part of the topic-word distributions, causing topics to be more coherent and ranked higher.
result_label: Differences between abstract and full-text data are more apparent within small document collections, with differences as large as 90% high-quality topics for full-text data, compared to 50% high-quality topics for abstract data.

TITLE: Time-dependent community structure in legislation cosponsorship networks in the Congress of the Republic of Peru
ABSTRACT: background_label: We study community structure in time-dependent legislation cosponsorship networks in the Peruvian Congress, and we compare them briefly to legislation cosponsorship networks in the US Senate.
method_label: To study these legislatures, we employ a multilayer representation of temporal networks in which legislators in each layer are connected to each other with a weight that is based on how many bills they cosponsor.
method_label: We then use multilayer modularity maximization to detect communities in these networks.
method_label: From our computations, we are able to capture power shifts in the Peruvian Congress during 2006--2011.
result_label: For example, we observe the emergence of 'opportunists', who switch from one community to another, as well as cohesive legislative communities whose initial component legislators never change communities.
result_label: Interestingly, many of the opportunists belong to the group that won the majority in Congress.

TITLE: Style Transfer as Unsupervised Machine Translation
ABSTRACT: background_label: Language style transferring rephrases text with specific stylistic attributes while preserving the original attribute-independent content.
background_label: One main challenge in learning a style transfer system is a lack of parallel data where the source sentence is in one style and the target sentence in another style.
objective_label: With this constraint, in this paper, we adapt unsupervised machine translation methods for the task of automatic style transfer.
method_label: We first take advantage of style-preference information and word embedding similarity to produce pseudo-parallel data with a statistical machine translation (SMT) framework.
method_label: Then the iterative back-translation approach is employed to jointly train two neural machine translation (NMT) based transfer systems.
method_label: To control the noise generated during joint training, a style classifier is introduced to guarantee the accuracy of style transfer and penalize bad candidates in the generated pseudo data.
result_label: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of both accuracy of style transfer and quality of input-output correspondence.

TITLE: Topic-link LDA: joint models of topic and author community
ABSTRACT: background_label: Given a large-scale linked document collection, such as a collection of blog posts or a research literature archive, there are two fundamental problems that have generated a lot of interest in the research community.
background_label: One is to identify a set of high-level topics covered by the documents in the collection; the other is to uncover and analyze the social network of the authors of the documents.
background_label: So far these problems have been viewed as separate problems and considered independently from each other.
objective_label: In this paper we argue that these two problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together.
method_label: We develop a Bayesian hierarchical approach that performs topic modeling and author community discovery in one unified framework.
result_label: The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated on two blog data sets in different domains and one research paper citation data from CiteSeer.

TITLE: Latent Discriminative Models for Social Emotion Detection with Emotional Dependency
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment analysis of such opinionated online texts as reviews and comments has received increasingly close attention, yet most of the work is intended to deal with the detection of authors’ emotion.
objective_label: In contrast, this article presents our study of the social emotion detection problem, the objective of which is to identify the evoked emotions of readers by online documents such as news articles.
method_label: A novel Latent Discriminative Model (LDM) is proposed for this task.
method_label: LDM works by introducing intermediate hidden variables to model the latent structure of input text corpora.
method_label: To achieve this, it defines a joint distribution over emotions and latent variables, conditioned on the observed text documents.
method_label: Moreover, we assume that social emotions are not independent but correlated with one another, and the dependency of them is capable of providing additional guidance to LDM in the training process.
method_label: The inclusion of this emotional dependency into LDM gives rise to a new Emotional Dependency-based LDM (eLDM).
result_label: We evaluate the proposed models through a series of empirical evaluations on two real-world corpora of news articles.
result_label: Experimental results verify the effectiveness of LDM and eLDM in social emotion detection.

TITLE: Trading Communities , the Networked Structure of International Relations , and the Kantian Peace
ABSTRACT: background_label: The authors argue that theories regarding the relationship between trade and conflict could benefit greatly from accounting for the networked structure of international trade.
background_label: Indirect trade relations reduce the probability of conflict by creating (1) opportunity costs of conflict beyond those reflected by direct trade ties and (2) negative externalities for the potential combatantsâ€™ trading partners, giving them an incentive to prevent the conflict.
background_label: Trade flows create groups of states with relatively dense trade ties, which we call trading communities.
background_label: Within these groups, the interruptions to trade caused by conflict create relatively large costs.
background_label: As a result, joint members of trading communities are less likely to go to war; however little they directly trade with each other.
method_label: The authors systematically measure and define trading communities across various levels of aggregation using the network analytic tool of modularity maximization.
result_label: The authors find significant support for their hypothesis, indicating that interdependence theory can be extended to extra-dyadic relations.

TITLE: Blogging as a means of knowledge sharing: Blog communities and informal learning in the blogosphere
ABSTRACT: background_label: This study explores problems related to knowledge sharing in the Information Age and attempts to provide a solution for them.
background_label: The primary problem revolves around the fact that the internet has too much information.
background_label: Locating the relevant information we are looking for is becoming harder since it is not well organized and quickly accessible online.
background_label: In addition to that, there is more “noise” available than useful quality content.
method_label: The research delves into the use of blogging as a fast, up-and-coming means of knowledge and quality content sharing amongst communities of bloggers with similar interests.
method_label: Knowledge sharing implies a bi-directional exchange of information.
result_label: To read blogs is not enough.
method_label: One must preferably start a blog and engage other bloggers with shared interests.
result_label: A blog is implemented, promoted and evaluated to analyze the usefulness of blogging as a means of knowledge sharing.

TITLE: The representation of the social sciences and humanities in the Web of Science—a comparison of publication patterns and incentive structures in Flanders and Norway (2005–9)
ABSTRACT: background_label: This article studies publication patterns in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in Flanders and Norway using two databases that both cover all SSH peer-reviewed journal articles by university scholars for the period 2005--9.
background_label: The coverage of journal articles by the Web of Science (WoS) and the proportion of articles published in English are studied in detail applying the same methodologies to both databases.
method_label: The study of WoS coverage and language use is chosen because the performance-based funding systems that are in place in both countries have given different emphasis to publishing in WoS covered journals.
result_label: The results show very similar, almost identical evolutions in the use of English as a publication language.
result_label: The proportion of articles covered by the WoS, however, is stable for Norway but has increased rapidly for Flanders.
result_label: This finding shows that the parameters used in a performance-based funding system may influence the publishing patterns of researchers.

TITLE: The expertise of digital fandom as a ‘community of practice’ Exploring the narrative universe of Doctor Who
ABSTRACT: background_label: It has been assumed that Web 2.0 has democratized participatory culture, challenging the significance of ‘expertise’ via ‘collective intelligence’ (Jenkins, 2006).
background_label: However, fan-cultural logics of expertise remain stratified in relation to ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger, 1998) where fandom-specific wikis transform pop-cultural narratives into databases of information (Booth, 2010: 105).
background_label: Such fan-generated content also challenges separations of database and narrative (Bassett, 2007: 178).
method_label: Focusing on Doctor Who fandom, I consider the ‘epistemological economy’ (Hastie, 2007) of Who fans’ expertise.
background_label: It has been argued that fans can be ‘industry driven’ or members of communities with histories of expertise (Busse and Gray, 2014: 431).
result_label: However, this industry/community binary is problematic, and instead, I argue that Doctor Who fan expertise has become part of a ‘nexus of multimembership’ (Wenger, 1998: 159) – placed in an uneasy position between the ‘official’ knowledge of showrunner fans and unofficial fan ...

TITLE: Discourse Processing
ABSTRACT: background_label: The observation that discourse is more than a mere sequence of utterances or sentences amounts to a truism.
background_label: But what follows from this?
background_label: In what way does the "value added" arise when segments of discourse are juxtaposed -how does hierarchical structure originate from a linearized discourse?While many discourse phenomena apply to dialogue and monologue alike, this tutorial will center its attention on monologue written text.
method_label: The perspective taken is that of practical language processing: We study methods for automatically deriving discourse information from text, and point to aspects of their implementation.
method_label: The emphasis is on breadth rather than depth, so that the attendees will get an overview of the central tasks of discourse processing, with pointers to the literature for studying the individual problems in more depth.
method_label: Much of the tutorial will follow the line of the recent book M. Stede: Discourse Processing.
method_label: Morgan & Claypool 2011.Specifically, we will study the most important ways of ascribing structure to discourse.
result_label: This is, first, a breakdown into functional units that are characteristic for the genre of the text.
background_label: A news message, for example, is conventionally structured in a different way than a scientific paper is.
background_label: For grasping this level of structure, the patterns that are characteristic for the specific genre need to be modeled.Second, an ongoing text, unless it is very short, will cover different topics and address them in a sensible linear order.
background_label: This is largely independent of genre, and since the notion of topic is relatively vague, it is harder to describe and sometimes difficult to identify.
method_label: The common approach is to track the distribution of content words across the text, but in addition, overt signals for topic switches can be exploited.Third, the identification of coreference links is a central aspect of discourse processing, and has received much attention in computational linguistics.
method_label: We will survey the corpus-based methods that have dominated the field in recent years, and 4 then look at the ramifications that the set of all coreference links in a text has for its structure.Fourth, we investigate the structure resulting from establishing coherence relations (e.g., Cause, Contrast) among adjacent text segments.
method_label: The term "discourse parsing" is often used for the task of identifying such relations (by exploiting more or less explicit linguistic signals) and building tree structures that reflect the semantic or pragmatic scaffolding of a (portion of) text.Thus emerges a picture of a text as a series of different, yet related, layers of analysis.
method_label: The final part of the tutorial addresses the issue of inter-connections between these levels.
method_label: As a tool for accessing such multi-layered text corpora, we will see how the (open-source) ANNIS2 database allows for querying the data across different layers, and for visualizing different structural layers in appropriate ways.2 Outline

TITLE: Co-Locating Style-Defining Elements on 3D Shapes
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce a method for co-locating style-defining elements over a set of 3D shapes.
objective_label: Our goal is to translate high-level style descriptions, such as “Ming” or “European” for furniture models, into explicit and localized regions over the geometric models that characterize each style.
method_label: For each style, the set of style-defining elements is defined as the union of all the elements that are able to discriminate the style.
method_label: Another property of the style-defining elements is that they are frequently occurring, reflecting shape characteristics that appear across multiple shapes of the same style.
method_label: Given an input set of 3D shapes spanning multiple categories and styles, where the shapes are grouped according to their style labels, we perform a cross-category co-analysis of the shape set to learn and spatially locate a set of defining elements for each style.
method_label: This is accomplished by first sampling a large number of candidate geometric elements and then iteratively applying feature selection to the candidates, to extract style-discriminating elements until no additional elements can be found.
result_label: Thus, for each style label, we obtain sets of discriminative elements that together form the superset of defining elements for the style.
result_label: We demonstrate that the co-location of style-defining elements allows us to solve problems such as style classification, and enables a variety of applications such as style-revealing view selection, style-aware sampling, and style-driven modeling for 3D shapes.

TITLE: Evolutionary detection of community structures in complex networks: A new fitness function
ABSTRACT: background_label: The discovery and analysis of communities in networks is a topic of high interest in sociology, biology and computer science.
background_label: Complex networks in nature and society range from the immune system and the brain to social, communication and transport networks.
background_label: The key issue in the development of algorithms able to automatically detect communities in complex networks refers to a meaningful quality evaluation of a community structure.
objective_label: Given a certain grouping of nodes into communities, a good measure is needed to evaluate the quality of the community structure based on the definition that a strong community has dense intra-connections and sparse outside-community links.
method_label: We propose a new fitness function for the assessment of community structures quality which is based on the number of nodes and their links inside a community versus the community size further reported to the size of the network.
method_label: A novel aspect of the proposed fitness function refers to considering the way nodes connect to other nodes inside the same community making this second level of links contribute to the strength of the community.
method_label: The introduced fitness function is tested inside a collaborative evolutionary algorithm specifically designed for the problem of community detection in complex networks.
method_label: Computational experiments are performed for several real-world complex networks which have a known real community structure.
result_label: This allows the direct verification of the quality of evolved communities via the proposed fitness function emphasizing extremely promising numerical results.

TITLE: Sentiment classification for Indonesian message in social media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Nowadays, social media has grown rapidly.
background_label: This growth makes people enjoy sharing their activities in social media, including complains about products or services from companies.
background_label: This behaviour is a big opportunity for a company to know sentiments of customer toward their company.
background_label: However, classifying sentiments from messages in social media has several challenges.
method_label: First, the language used in social media often does not have formal structure in their sentence, such as the use of abbreviations, change of letters to numbers, lack of punctuation marks, etc.
background_label: Second, sentences in social media are domain independent so it's hard to classify the sentence.
method_label: Related with these challenges, this paper discusses a method to classify sentiments on social media, which is written in Indonesian language.
method_label: The method we use is to classify each sentence into several classes of sentiment.
method_label: Before the classification, sentence transformation is done to transform the informal words in the sentence into formal words.
method_label: The transformation method that we use is the deletion of punctuation mark, the tokenization, the conversion of number to letter, the reduction of repetition letter, the Levensthein distance and using corpus to formalize abbreviation.
method_label: Formalized sentence will be the input to the classification model for data training and classification process.
method_label: We classify the message into four classes: Neutral (fact, greetings, etc.
method_label: ), Question, Positive Sentiment, and Negative Sentiment.
method_label: SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Maximum Entropy are used as the classification algorithms with machine learning features of count of positive, negative, and question word in sentence.
result_label: From our experimental result, the best classification method is SVM that yields 86,66% accuracy.

TITLE: Losing It Online: Characterizing Participation in an Online Weight Loss Community
ABSTRACT: background_label: Many people struggle with their weight and are turning to online communities for social and informational support.
objective_label: The aim of this study is to understand the issues commonly discussed in online weight loss communities.
method_label: Through observation and content analysis of threads in one specific weight loss community, we identified 17 distinct categories discussed by the participants.
method_label: We detail four categories specifically: Personal Experience, Consumption Choices, Dieting Strategy, and Exercise.
method_label: Our analysis describes some key user roles and states that often relate to different phases of a person's weight loss journey.
result_label: We identify a set of transient states, which are not proper roles but are significant in an online community where individuals are attempting to change their own behaviors.
result_label: We close with design suggestions for encouraging and maintaining participant engagement in an online health community

TITLE: A Latent Concept Topic Model for Robust Topic Inference Using Word Embeddings
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractUncovering thematic structures of SNS and blog posts is a crucial yet challenging task, because of the severe data sparsity induced by the short length of texts and diverse use of vocabulary.
background_label: This hinders effective topic inference of traditional LDA because it infers topics based on document-level co-occurrence of words.
method_label: To robustly infer topics in such contexts, we propose a latent concept topic model (LCTM).
method_label: Unlike LDA, LCTM reveals topics via co-occurrence of latent concepts, which we introduce as latent variables to capture conceptual similarity of words.
method_label: More specifically, LCTM models each topic as a distribution over the latent concepts, where each latent concept is a localized Gaussian distribution over the word embedding space.
method_label: Since the number of unique concepts in a corpus is often much smaller than the number of unique words, LCTM is less susceptible to the data sparsity.
result_label: Experiments on the 20Newsgroups show the effectiveness of LCTM in dealing with short texts as well as the capability of the model in handling held-out documents with a high degree of OOV words.

TITLE: Structural and temporal analysis of the blogosphere through community factorization
ABSTRACT: background_label: The blogosphere has unique structural and temporal properties since blogs are typically used as communication media among human individuals.
objective_label: In this paper, we propose a novel technique that captures the structure and temporal dynamics of blog communities.
method_label: In our framework, a community is a set of blogs that communicate with each other triggered by some events (such as a news article).
method_label: The community is represented by its structure and temporal dynamics: a community graph indicates how often one blog communicates with another, and a community intensity indicates the activity level of the community that varies over time.
method_label: Our method, community factorization, extracts such communities from the blogosphere, where the communication among blogs is observed as a set of subgraphs (i.e., threads of discussion).
method_label: This community extraction is formulated as a factorization problem in the framework of constrained optimization, in which the objective is to best explain the observed interactions in the blogosphere over time.
method_label: We further provide a scalable algorithm for computing solutions to the constrained optimization problems.
result_label: Extensive experimental studies on both synthetic and real blog data demonstrate that our technique is able to discover meaningful communities that are not detectable by traditional methods.

TITLE: Improved Stance Prediction in a User Similarity Feature Space
ABSTRACT: background_label: Predicting the stance of social media users on a topic can be challenging, particularly for users who never express explicit stances.
background_label: Earlier work has shown that using users' historical or non-relevant tweets can be used to predict stance.
method_label: We build on prior work by making use of users' interaction elements, such as retweeted accounts and mentioned hashtags, to compute the similarities between users and to classify new users in a user similarity feature space.
result_label: We show that this approach significantly improves stance prediction on two datasets that differ in terms of language, topic, and cultural background.

TITLE: TM-LDA: efficient online modeling of latent topic transitions in social media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Latent topic analysis has emerged as one of the most effective methods for classifying, clustering and retrieving textual data.
background_label: However, existing models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were developed for static corpora of relatively large documents.
background_label: In contrast, much of the textual content on the web, and especially social media, is temporally sequenced, and comes in short fragments, including microblog posts on sites such as Twitter and Weibo, status updates on social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, or comments on content sharing sites such as YouTube.
objective_label: In this paper we propose a novel topic model, Temporal-LDA or TM-LDA, for efficiently mining text streams such as a sequence of posts from the same author, by modeling the topic transitions that naturally arise in these data.
method_label: TM-LDA learns the transition parameters among topics by minimizing the prediction error on topic distribution in subsequent postings.
method_label: After training, TM-LDA is thus able to accurately predict the expected topic distribution in future posts.
method_label: To make these predictions more efficient for a realistic online setting, we develop an efficient updating algorithm to adjust the topic transition parameters, as new documents stream in.
result_label: Our empirical results, over a corpus of over 30 million microblog posts, show that TM-LDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art static LDA models for estimating the topic distribution of new documents over time.
result_label: We also demonstrate that TM-LDA is able to highlight interesting variations of common topic transitions, such as the differences in the work-life rhythm of cities, and factors associated with area-specific problems and complaints.

TITLE: Quantifying the evolution of a scientific topic: reaction of the academic community to the Chornobyl disaster
ABSTRACT: background_label: We analyze the reaction of academic communities to a particular urgent topic which abruptly arises as a scientific problem.
method_label: To this end, we have chosen the disaster that occurred in 1986 in Chornobyl (Chernobyl), Ukraine, considered as one of the most devastating nuclear power plant accidents in history.
method_label: The academic response is evaluated using scientific-publication data concerning the disaster using the Scopus database to present the picture on an international scale and the bibliographic database"Ukrainika naukova"to consider it on a national level.
method_label: We measured distributions of papers in different scientific fields, their growth rates and properties of co-authorship networks.
method_label: {The elements of descriptive statistics and the tools of the complex network theory are used to highlight the interdisciplinary as well as international effects.}
result_label: Our analysis allows to compare contributions of the international community to Chornobyl-related research as well as integration of Ukraine in the international research on this subject.
result_label: Furthermore, the content analysis of titles and abstracts of the publications allowed to detect the most important terms used for description of Chornobyl-related problems.

TITLE: HierarchicalTopics: Visually Exploring Large Text Collections Using Topic Hierarchies
ABSTRACT: background_label: Analyzing large textual collections has become increasingly challenging given the size of the data available and the rate that more data is being generated.
background_label: Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora.
background_label: As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora.
background_label: However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible.
method_label: To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system - HierarchicalTopic (HT).
method_label: HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface.
background_label: The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics.
method_label: The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion.
method_label: User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space.
method_label: To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups.
method_label: We have also conducted a user study to quantitatively evaluate the effect of hierarchical topic structure.
result_label: The study results reveal that the HT leads to faster identification of large number of relevant topics.
result_label: We have also solicited user feedback during the experiments and incorporated some suggestions into the current version of HierarchicalTopics.

TITLE: Interdisciplinarity of scientific fields and its evolution based on graph of project collaboration and co-authoring
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The paper investigates interdisciplinarity of scientific fields based on graph of collaboration between the researchers.
objective_label: A new measure for interdisciplinarity is proposed that takes into account graph content and structure.
method_label: Similarity between science categories is estimated based on text similarity between their descriptions.
method_label: The proposed new measure is applied in exploratory analysis of research community in Slovenia.
result_label: We found that Biotechnology and Natural sciences are the most interdisciplinary in their publications and collaborations on research projects.
result_label: In addition evolution of interdisciplinarity of scientific fields in Slovenia is observed, showing that over the last decade interdisciplinarity increases the fastest in Medical sciences mainly due to collaborations with Natural and Technical sciences.

TITLE: Expertise localization discovered through correlation of key term distribution and community detection in co-author networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: We present an efficient and effective automatic method for determining the research focus of scientific communities found in co-authorship networks.
method_label: It utilizes bibliographic data from a database to form the network, followed by fastgreedy community detection to identify communities within large connected components of the network.
method_label: Text analysis techniques are used to identify community-specific significant terms which represent the topic of the community.
method_label: In order to greatly reduce computation time, the `Topics' field of each publication in the network is analyzed rather than its entire text.
method_label: Using this text analysis approach requires a certain level of statistical confidence,therefore analyzing very small communities is not effective with this technique.
result_label: We find a minimum community size threshold of 8 coauthored papers; below this value, the community's topic cannot be reliably identified with this method.
result_label: Additionally, we consider the implications this study has regarding factors involved in the formation of scientific communities in co-authorship networks.

TITLE: External evaluation of topic models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic models can learn topics that are highly interpretable, semantically-coherent and can be used similarly to subject headings.
background_label: But sometimes learned topics are lists of words that do not convey much useful information.
objective_label: We propose models that score the usefulness of topics, including a model that computes a score based on pointwise mutual information (PMI) of pairs of words in a topic.
method_label: Our PMI score, computed using word-pair co-occurrence statistics from external data sources, has relatively good agreement with human scoring.
result_label: We also show that the ability to identify less useful topics can improve the results of a topic-based document similarity metric.

TITLE: Conceptual principles of the system (emergent) information theory and its application for the cognitive modelling of the active objects (entities)
ABSTRACT: background_label: The generalisation of the Hartley-Schennon information theory has been proposed by way of considering the quantum and active entities as the objects on the basis of the analysis of which the basic conception of the information itself has been developed (shaped).
background_label: The information theory generalised in this way is suggested to call the system or the emergent information theory.
method_label: The major distinction of the emergent information theory from the classical one is the account of the properties of the systematic character both of the fundamental and universal properties of all the objects (entities) at the level of the information conception itself, and not just in what follows, as in the classical theory.
result_label: The generalised (generic) decision tables have been generated in which the inputs (factors) and outputs; the future states of the control active object are linked together with the help of different meanings of the truth expressed in bytes and taking the meanings from the theoretically maximum allowable positive to the theoretically unrestricted negative.

TITLE: Pachinko allocation: DAG-structured mixture models of topic correlations
ABSTRACT: background_label: Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and other related topic models are increasingly popular tools for summarization and manifold discovery in discrete data.
background_label: However, LDA does not capture correlations between topics.
objective_label: In this paper, we introduce the pachinko allocation model (PAM), which captures arbitrary, nested, and possibly sparse correlations between topics using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
method_label: The leaves of the DAG represent individual words in the vocabulary, while each interior node represents a correlation among its children, which may be words or other interior nodes (topics).
method_label: PAM provides a flexible alternative to recent work by Blei and Lafferty (2006), which captures correlations only between pairs of topics.
result_label: Using text data from newsgroups, historic NIPS proceedings and other research paper corpora, we show improved performance of PAM in document classification, likelihood of held-out data, the ability to support finer-grained topics, and topical keyword coherence.

TITLE: Permanence and Community Structure in Complex Networks
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The goal of community detection algorithms is to identify densely-connected units within large networks.
background_label: An implicit assumption is that all the constituent nodes belong equally to their associated community.
background_label: However, some nodes are more important in the community than others.
background_label: To date, efforts have been primarily driven to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding to what extent an individual node belongs to its community.
result_label: Therefore, most metrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global.
background_label: These metrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node.
background_label: In this paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not uniform.
background_label: The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength of membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the extent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its community, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally.
method_label: We discuss how permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution of communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the persistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen the community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a community, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading.
method_label: We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful communities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the networks more accurately than eight other popular community detection algorithms.
result_label: Finally, we show that the communities obtained by this method are (i) less affected by the changes in vertex-ordering, and (ii) more resilient to resolution limit, degeneracy of solutions and asymptotic growth of values.

TITLE: Interactive Visual Exploration of Topic Models using Graphs
ABSTRACT: background_label: Probabilistic topic modeling is a popular and powerful family of tools for uncovering thematic structure in large sets of unstructured text documents.
background_label: While much attention has been directed towards the modeling algorithms and their various extensions, comparatively few studies have concerned how to present or visualize topic models in meaningful ways.
objective_label: In this paper, we present a novel design that uses graphs to visually communicate topic structure and meaning.
method_label: By connecting topic nodes via descriptive keyterms, the graph representation reveals topic similarities, topic meaning and shared, ambiguous keyterms.
method_label: At the same time, the graph can be used for information retrieval purposes, to find documents by topic or topic subsets.
result_label: To exemplify the utility of the design, we illustrate its use for organizing and exploring corpora of financial patents.

TITLE: Semantic Variation in Online Communities of Practice
ABSTRACT: background_label: We introduce a framework for quantifying semantic variation of common words in Communities of Practice and in sets of topic-related communities.
background_label: We show that while some meaning shifts are shared across related communities, others are community-specific, and therefore independent from the discussed topic.
method_label: We propose such findings as evidence in favour of sociolinguistic theories of socially-driven semantic variation.
result_label: Results are evaluated using an independent language modelling task.
result_label: Furthermore, we investigate extralinguistic features and show that factors such as prominence and dissemination of words are related to semantic variation.

TITLE: Quantifying Controversy on Social Media
ABSTRACT: background_label: Which topics spark the most heated debates on social media?
background_label: Identifying those topics is not only interesting from a societal point of view but also allows the filtering and aggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories.
objective_label: In this article, we perform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content and the network structure of social media.
method_label: Unlike previous work, rather than studying controversy in a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge, we take a general approach to study topics in any domain.
method_label: Our approach to quantifying controversy is based on a graph-based three-stage pipeline, which involves (i) building a conversation graph about a topic, (ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of the controversy, and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the graph.
method_label: We perform an extensive comparison of controversy measures, different graph-building approaches, and data sources.
method_label: We use both controversial and non-controversial topics on Twitter, as well as other external datasets.
result_label: We find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in capturing the intuitive notion of controversy and show that content features are vastly less helpful in this task.

TITLE: Identifying Ideological Perspectives in Text and Video
ABSTRACT: background_label: Polarizing opinions about political and social controversies take place commonly in mass and more recently user-generated media.
background_label: A functional democratic society builds on civic discussions among people holding different beliefs on an issue.
background_label: However, so far, few computer technologies have been devoted to facilitate mutual understanding, and arguably could have worsened the situation.
background_label: We envision a computer system that can automatically understand different ideological viewpoints on an issue and identify biased news stories, blog posts, and television news.
background_label: Such a computer system will raise news readers' awareness of individual sources' biases and encourage them to seek news stories from different viewpoints.
background_label: · Computer understanding of ideological perspectives, however, has been long considered almost impossible.
method_label: In this thesis, we show that ideology, although very abstract, exhibits a concrete pattern when it is communicated among a group of people who share similar beliefs in written text, spoken text, television news production, and web video folksonomies.
result_label: This emphatic pattern in ideological discourse opens up a new field of automatic ideological analysis, and enables a large amount of ideological text and video to be automatically analyzed.
background_label: · We develop a new statistical model, called Joint Topic and Perspective Models, based on the emphatic pattern in ideological discourse.
background_label: The model combines two essential aspects of ideological discourse: topic matters and ideological biases.
background_label: The simultaneous inference on topics and ideological emphasis, however, poses a computational challenge.
method_label: We thus develop an approximate inference algorithm for the model based on variational methods.
method_label: · The emphatic pattern in ideological discourse and the Joint Topic and Perspective Model enable many interesting applications in text analysis and multimedia content understanding.
method_label: At the corpus level, we show that ideological discourse can be reliably distinguished from non-ideological discourse.
result_label: At the document level, we show that the perspective from which a document is written or a video is produced can be identified with high accuracy.
result_label: At the sentence level, we extend the model to summarize an ideological document by selecting sentences that strongly express a particular perspective.

TITLE: Measuring Health Information Dissemination and Identifying Target Interest Communities on Twitter: Methods Development and Case Study of the @SafetyMD Network
ABSTRACT: background_label: BACKGROUND Little is known about the ability of individual stakeholder groups to achieve health information dissemination goals through Twitter.
objective_label: OBJECTIVE This study aimed to develop and apply methods for the systematic evaluation and optimization of health information dissemination by stakeholders through Twitter.
method_label: METHODS Tweet content from 1790 followers of @SafetyMD (July-November 2012) was examined.
method_label: User emphasis, a new indicator of Twitter information dissemination, was defined and applied to retweets across two levels of retweeters originating from @SafetyMD.
method_label: User interest clusters were identified based on principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of a random sample of 170 followers.
result_label: RESULTS User emphasis of keywords remained across levels but decreased by 9.5 percentage points.
result_label: PCA and HCA identified 12 statistically unique clusters of followers within the @SafetyMD Twitter network.
result_label: CONCLUSIONS This study is one of the first to develop methods for use by stakeholders to evaluate and optimize their use of Twitter to disseminate health information.
result_label: Our new methods provide preliminary evidence that individual stakeholders can evaluate the effectiveness of health information dissemination and create content-specific clusters for more specific targeted messaging.

TITLE: The Social Context of Cannibalism in Migratory Bands of the Mormon Cricket
ABSTRACT: background_label: Cannibalism has been shown to be important to the collective motion of mass migratory bands of insects, such as locusts and Mormon crickets.
background_label: These mobile groups consist of millions of individuals and are highly destructive to vegetation.
background_label: Individuals move in response to attacks from approaching conspecifics and bite those ahead, resulting in further movement and encounters with others.
background_label: Despite the importance of cannibalism, the way in which individuals make attack decisions and how the social context affects these cannibalistic interactions is unknown.
objective_label: This can be understood by examining the decisions made by individuals in response to others.
method_label: We performed a field investigation which shows that adult Mormon crickets were more likely to approach and attack a stationary cricket that was side-on to the flow than either head- or abdomen-on, suggesting that individuals could reduce their risk of an attack by aligning with neighbours.
result_label: We found strong social effects on cannibalistic behaviour: encounters lasted longer, were more likely to result in an attack, and attacks were more likely to be successful if other individuals were present around a stationary individual.
result_label: This local aggregation appears to be driven by positive feedback whereby the presence of individuals attracts others, which can lead to further crowding.
result_label: This work improves our understanding of the local social dynamics driving migratory band formation, maintenance and movement at the population level.

TITLE: Automatic Evaluation of Topic Coherence
ABSTRACT: background_label: AbstractThis paper introduces the novel task of topic coherence evaluation, whereby a set of words, as generated by a topic model, is rated for coherence or interpretability.
method_label: We apply a range of topic scoring models to the evaluation task, drawing on WordNet, Wikipedia and the Google search engine, and existing research on lexical similarity/relatedness.
result_label: In comparison with human scores for a set of learned topics over two distinct datasets, we show a simple co-occurrence measure based on pointwise mutual information over Wikipedia data is able to achieve results for the task at or nearing the level of inter-annotator correlation, and that other Wikipedia-based lexical relatedness methods also achieve strong results.
result_label: Google produces strong, if less consistent, results, while our results over WordNet are patchy at best.

TITLE: Lying to Tell the Truth: Journalists and the Social Context of Deception
ABSTRACT: background_label: This study, based on depth interviews with journalists, is an analysis of the social context of journalistic deception.
objective_label: Borrowing from Elliot and Culver's (1992) comprehensive definition of journalistic deception that covered not only newsgathering practices but also the potential for deception in journalists' relationships with news audiences, as well as the omission-commission distinction, this research is an empirical attempt to locate the occupational and individual-grounded bases for deception.
method_label: Why do journalists use deceptive methods such as impersonations, nonidentifications, and fabrication in their work?
method_label: Deception is located in a moral-pragmatic framework based on harm-benefit, the altruism of the act, and instrumental utilities such as convenience, personal safety, and the bottom line.
result_label: Woven into the journalists' accounts are attempts to normalize deceptive behavior-consistent with the notion of deception as a prima facie wrong-and the salience of organizational pressures such as legal and busin...

TITLE: Conversation Modeling on Reddit using a Graph-Structured LSTM
ABSTRACT: objective_label: This paper presents a novel approach for modeling threaded discussions on social media using a graph-structured bidirectional LSTM which represents both hierarchical and temporal conversation structure.
method_label: In experiments with a task of predicting popularity of comments in Reddit discussions, the proposed model outperforms a node-independent architecture for different sets of input features.
result_label: Analyses show a benefit to the model over the full course of the discussion, improving detection in both early and late stages.
result_label: Further, the use of language cues with the bidirectional tree state updates helps with identifying controversial comments.

TITLE: Incorporating popularity in topic models for social network analysis
ABSTRACT: background_label: Topic models are used to group words in a text dataset into a set of relevant topics.
background_label: Unfortunately, when a few words frequently appear in a dataset, the topic groups identified by topic models become noisy because these frequent words repeatedly appear in "irrelevant" topic groups.
background_label: This noise has not been a serious problem in a text dataset because the frequent words (e.g., the and is) do not have much meaning and have been simply removed before a topic model analysis.
background_label: However, in a social network dataset we are interested in, they correspond to popular persons (e.g., Barack Obama and Justin Bieber) and cannot be simply removed because most people are interested in them.
method_label: To solve this "popularity problem", we explicitly model the popularity of nodes (words) in topic models.
method_label: For this purpose, we first introduce a notion of a "popularity component" and propose topic model extensions that effectively accommodate the popularity component.
result_label: We evaluate the effectiveness of our models with a real-world Twitter dataset.
result_label: Our proposed models achieve significantly lower perplexity (i.e., better prediction power) compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
result_label: In addition to the popularity problem caused by the nodes with high incoming edge degree, we also investigate the effect of the outgoing edge degree with another topic model extensions.
result_label: We show that considering outgoing edge degree does not help much in achieving lower perplexity.

TITLE: Social topic models for community extraction
ABSTRACT: background_label: With social interaction playing an increasingly important role in the online world, the capability to extract latent communities based on such interactions is becoming vital for a wide variety of applications.
background_label: However, existing literature on community extraction has largely focused on methods based on the link structure of a given social network.
background_label: Such link-based methods ignore the content of social interactions, which may be crucial for accurate and meaningful community extraction.
method_label: In this paper, we present a Bayesian generative model for community extraction which naturally incorporates both the link and content information present in the social network.
method_label: The model assumes that actors in a community communicate on topics of mutual interest, and the topics of communication, in turn, determine the communities.
method_label: Further, the model naturally allows actors to belong to multiple communities.
method_label: The model is instantiated in the context of an email network, and a Gibbs sampling algorithm is presented to do inference.
result_label: Through extensive experiments and visualization on the Enron email corpus, we demonstrate that the model is able to extract well-connected and topically meaningful communities.
result_label: Additionally, the model extracts relevant topics that can be mapped back to corresponding real-life events involving Enron.

TITLE: A separability framework for analyzing community structure
ABSTRACT: background_label: Four major factors govern the intricacies of community extraction in networks: (1) the literature offers a multitude of disparate community detection algorithms whose output exhibits high structural variability across the collection, (2) communities identified by algorithms may differ structurally from real communities that arise in practice, (3) there is no consensus characterizing how to discriminate communities from noncommunities, and (4) the application domain includes a wide variety of networks of fundamentally different natures.
objective_label: In this article, we present a class separability framework to tackle these challenges through a comprehensive analysis of community properties.
method_label: Our approach enables the assessment of the structural dissimilarity among the output of multiple community detection algorithms and between the output of algorithms and communities that arise in practice.
method_label: In addition, our method provides us with a way to organize the vast collection of community detection algorithms by grouping those that behave similarly.
method_label: Finally, we identify the most discriminative graph-theoretical properties of community signature and the small subset of properties that account for most of the biases of the different community detection algorithms.
method_label: We illustrate our approach with an experimental analysis, which reveals nuances of the structure of real and extracted communities.
method_label: In our experiments, we furnish our framework with the output of 10 different community detection procedures, representative of categories of popular algorithms available in the literature, applied to a diverse collection of large-scale real network datasets whose domains span biology, online shopping, and social systems.
method_label: We also analyze communities identified by annotations that accompany the data, which reflect exemplar communities in various domain.
method_label: We characterize these communities using a broad spectrum of community properties to produce the different structural classes.
result_label: As our experiments show that community structure is not a universal concept, our framework enables an informed choice of the most suitable community detection method for identifying communities of a specific type in a given network and allows for a comparison of existing community detection algorithms while guiding the design of new ones.

TITLE: Twitter sentiment analysis using multi-class SVM
ABSTRACT: background_label: Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a field which is used to study the user's opinions towards a product or an organization or a person.
background_label: Twitter, a micro-blogging service allows the user to share their opinions and aspects of life.
background_label: Sentiment analysis on twitter is a big challenge because it has diverse topics.
background_label: The classifier that is trained on a specific topic will not perform well on another topic.
method_label: So, the topic adaptive training method is proposed to address this problem.
method_label: In this method, non-text features are also extracted from tweets for training the algorithm.
method_label: The algorithm classifies the tweets of different topics as positive, negative, neutral.
result_label: The proposed method is evaluated across different topics and it outperforms in terms of recall, precision and F-score.

TITLE: How Online Communities of People With Long-Term Conditions Function and Evolve: Network Analysis of the Structure and Dynamics of the Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Online Communities
ABSTRACT: background_label: BACKGROUND Self-management support can improve health and reduce health care utilization by people with long-term conditions.
background_label: Online communities for people with long-term conditions have the potential to influence health, usage of health care resources, and facilitate illness self-management.
background_label: Only recently, however, has evidence been reported on how such communities function and evolve, and how they support self-management of long-term conditions in practice.
objective_label: OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying online self-management support systems by analyzing the structure and dynamics of the networks connecting users who write posts over time.
method_label: METHODS We conducted a longitudinal network analysis of anonymized data from 2 patients' online communities from the United Kingdom: the Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation (BLF) communities in 2006-2016 and 2012-2016, respectively.
result_label: RESULTS The number of users and activity grew steadily over time, reaching 3345 users and 32,780 posts in the Asthma UK community, and 19,837 users and 875,151 posts in the BLF community.
result_label: People who wrote posts in the Asthma UK forum tended to write at an interval of 1-20 days and six months, while those in the BLF community wrote at an interval of two days.
result_label: In both communities, most pairs of users could reach one another either directly or indirectly through other users.
result_label: Those who wrote a disproportionally large number of posts (the superusers) represented 1% of the overall population of both Asthma UK and BLF communities and accounted for 32% and 49% of the posts, respectively.
background_label: Sensitivity analysis showed that the removal of superusers would cause the communities to collapse.
background_label: Thus, interactions were held together by very few superusers, who posted frequently and regularly, 65% of them at least every 1.7 days in the BLF community and 70% every 3.1 days in the Asthma UK community.
background_label: Their posting activity indirectly facilitated tie formation between other users.
background_label: Superusers were a constantly available resource, with a mean of 80 and 20 superusers active at any one time in the BLF and Asthma UK communities, respectively.
background_label: Over time, the more active users became, the more likely they were to reply to other users' posts rather than to write new ones, shifting from a help-seeking to a help-giving role.
result_label: This might suggest that superusers were more likely to provide than to seek advice.
result_label: CONCLUSIONS In this study, we uncover key structural properties related to the way users interact and sustain online health communities.
result_label: Superusers' engagement plays a fundamental sustaining role and deserves research attention.
result_label: Further studies are needed to explore network determinants of the effectiveness of online engagement concerning health-related outcomes.
result_label: In resource-constrained health care systems, scaling up online communities may offer a potentially accessible, wide-reaching and cost-effective intervention facilitating greater levels of self-management.

TITLE: Best Topic Word Selection for Topic Labelling
ABSTRACT: objective_label: AbstractThis paper presents the novel task of best topic word selection, that is the selection of the topic word that is the best label for a given topic, as a means of enhancing the interpretation and visualisation of topic models.
method_label: We propose a number of features intended to capture the best topic word, and show that, in combination as inputs to a reranking model, we are able to consistently achieve results above the baseline of simply selecting the highest-ranked topic word.
result_label: This is the case both when training in-domain over other labelled topics for that topic model, and cross-domain, using only labellings from independent topic models learned over document collections from different domains and genres.

TITLE: Question routing to user communities
ABSTRACT: objective_label: An online community consists of a group of users who share a common interest, background, or experience and their collective goal is to contribute towards the welfare of the community members.
background_label: Question answering is an important feature that enables community members to exchange knowledge within the community boundary.
background_label: The overwhelming number of communities necessitates the need for a good question routing strategy so that new questions gets routed to the appropriately focused community and thus get resolved.
objective_label: In this paper, we consider the novel problem of routing questions to the right community and propose a framework to select the right set of communities for a question.
method_label: We begin by using several prior proposed features for users and add some additional features, namely language attributes and inclination to respond, for community modeling.
method_label: Then we introduce two k nearest neighbor based aggregation algorithms for computing community scores.
result_label: We show how these scores can be combined to recommend communities and test the effectiveness of the recommendations over a large real world dataset.

TITLE: LingSync & the Online Linguistic Database: New Models for the Collection and Management of Data for Language Communities, Linguists and Language Learners
ABSTRACT: background_label: LingSync and the Online Linguistic Database (OLD) are new models for the collection and management of data in endangered language settings.
background_label: The LingSync and OLD projects seek to close a feedback loop between field linguists, language communities, software developers, and computational linguists by creating web services and user interfaces (UIs) which facilitate collaborative and inclusive language documentation.
objective_label: This paper presents the architectures of these tools and the resources generated thus far.
method_label: We also briefly discuss some of the features of the systems which are particularly helpful to endangered languages fieldwork and which should also be of interest to computational linguists, these being a service that automates the identification of utterances within audio/video, another that automates the alignment of audio recordings and transcriptions, and a number of services that automate the morphological parsing task.
result_label: The paper discusses the requirements of software used for endangered language documentation, and presents novel data which demonstrates that users are actively seeking alternatives despite existing software.

TITLE: Community currency activities, community attachment, and quality of life: A case study of the Crooked River Alliance of TimeBanks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Adopting community currency has been considered an effective strategy to improve local economies and social environments.
background_label: Socioeconomic benefits of community currency for users have been well documented in previous studies; however, the community and quality of life benefits of community currency and the differences in such benefits between the users and non-users of community currency have not been sufficiently examined.
method_label: To develop evidence-based approaches toward promoting community currency, this study has two main objectives: first to discuss the current state of knowledge on community currency in terms of its trends, correlates, and benefits; and second to present an empirical study based on a survey of 77 community currency users and 42 non-users, which examines the potential roles of community currency activities in promoting community attachment and quality of life.
result_label: Results demonstrated that among community currency users, more active community currency users had higher levels of community attachment and quality of life.
result_label: Also, compared to non-users, community currency users showed higher levels of quality of life.
result_label: Evidence from this study suggests community currency holds strong potential to serve as an important mechanism to provide unmet, or additional, social services.
result_label: It may also contribute to delivering multiple social objectives, such as improving social cohesion and empowering active citizenship.

TITLE: Anime Style Space Exploration Using Metric Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks
ABSTRACT: background_label: Deep learning-based style transfer between images has recently become a popular area of research.
background_label: A common way of encoding"style"is through a feature representation based on the Gram matrix of features extracted by some pre-trained neural network or some other form of feature statistics.
background_label: Such a definition is based on an arbitrary human decision and may not best capture what a style really is.
method_label: In trying to gain a better understanding of"style", we propose a metric learning-based method to explicitly encode the style of an artwork.
method_label: In particular, our definition of style captures the differences between artists, as shown by classification performances, and such that the style representation can be interpreted, manipulated and visualized through style-conditioned image generation through a Generative Adversarial Network.
method_label: We employ this method to explore the style space of anime portrait illustrations.

TITLE: The MTSOCS: A multidimensional sense of community scale for local communities
ABSTRACT: objective_label: The aim of this study was to validate the Multidimensional Territorial Sense of Community Scale (MTSOCS), a new theory-driven sense of community scale referred to the geographical community.
method_label: Starting from McMillan and Chavis' theoretical dimensions, five subscales (Membership, Shared Influence, Social Climate and Bonds, Help in Case of Need, and Needs Fulfillment) were proposed.
method_label: The MTSOCS, a sociodemographic questionnaire, and several other instruments were administered to three groups of adults (for a total of 781 participants).
method_label: Confirmatory factor analysis of all participants' data showed that the five subscales were good from a statistical point of view.
result_label: Tests of factorial invariance showed that the five-factor model of the MTSOCS is basically the same across different-sized territorial communities: small towns, cities and metropolis neighborhoods.
result_label: The total score of the scale and the five subscales showed good construct validity.
result_label: A positive relationship emerged between total MTSOCS score and participation in groups/associations, cohabitation, community identification, life satisfaction, perceived social support, interpersonal trust and trust in local government.
result_label: More complex relationships emerged between the five subscales and the other variables, confirming the usefulness of also having the single subscale scores.

TITLE: Prior-aware Dual Decomposition: Document-specific Topic Inference for Spectral Topic Models
ABSTRACT: background_label: Spectral topic modeling algorithms operate on matrices/tensors of word co-occurrence statistics to learn topic-specific word distributions.
background_label: This approach removes the dependence on the original documents and produces substantial gains in efficiency and provable topic inference, but at a cost: the model can no longer provide information about the topic composition of individual documents.
method_label: Recently Thresholded Linear Inverse (TLI) is proposed to map the observed words of each document back to its topic composition.
method_label: However, its linear characteristics limit the inference quality without considering the important prior information over topics.
method_label: In this paper, we evaluate Simple Probabilistic Inverse (SPI) method and novel Prior-aware Dual Decomposition (PADD) that is capable of learning document-specific topic compositions in parallel.
result_label: Experiments show that PADD successfully leverages topic correlations as a prior, notably outperforming TLI and learning quality topic compositions comparable to Gibbs sampling on various data.

TITLE: Topic-based Evaluation for Conversational Bots
ABSTRACT: background_label: Dialog evaluation is a challenging problem, especially for non task-oriented dialogs where conversational success is not well-defined.
objective_label: We propose to evaluate dialog quality using topic-based metrics that describe the ability of a conversational bot to sustain coherent and engaging conversations on a topic, and the diversity of topics that a bot can handle.
method_label: To detect conversation topics per utterance, we adopt Deep Average Networks (DAN) and train a topic classifier on a variety of question and query data categorized into multiple topics.
method_label: We propose a novel extension to DAN by adding a topic-word attention table that allows the system to jointly capture topic keywords in an utterance and perform topic classification.
result_label: We compare our proposed topic based metrics with the ratings provided by users and show that our metrics both correlate with and complement human judgment.
result_label: Our analysis is performed on tens of thousands of real human-bot dialogs from the Alexa Prize competition and highlights user expectations for conversational bots.
